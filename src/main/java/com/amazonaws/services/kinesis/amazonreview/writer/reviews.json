For someone who is an experienced web designer, this course is a high-level review of the CS5 version of Dreamweaver, but it doesnt go into a great enough level of detail to find it very useful.On the other hand, this is a great tool for someone who is a relative novice at web design.  It starts off with a basic overview of HTML and continues through the concepts necessary to build a modern web site.  Someone who goes through this course should exit with enough knowledge to create something that does what you want it do do...within reason.  Dont expect to go off and build an entire e-commerce system with only this class under your belt.Its important to note that theres a long gap from site design to actual implementation.  This course teaches you how to implement a design.  The user interface and overall user experience is a different subject that isnt covered here...its possible to do a great implementation of an absolutely abysmal design.  I speak from experience.  :)As I said above, if youre a novice, a relative newcomer or just an experienced web designer who wants a refresher course, this is a good way to do it.", "unixReviewTime": "1287532800"}

It is not, however, a tutorial on the best way to lay out a site using CSS or anything like that. For that, youll need a book or two on that subject.She has a site that has some helpful resources, e.g. checklists for project management and site development, and helpful URLs. All in all, its a decent introduction to creating web sites.She sounds weird, though, like a robot (or Stephen Hawkings voicebox) with her halting, clipped delivery. She tends to be slightly chatty and repeat material, but its not that bad; could be helpful for retention for people new to the subject.UI - at the top of the interface, theres a Previous Video button and Next Video button. The Next Video button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one youll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read Take Test instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.Theres a Watch and Work mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, youll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.All in all, a good value if you want to learn DreamWeaver.", "unixReviewTime": "1287360000"}

Dreamweaver is the premier product for website creation.  It offers several new advantages/features for the user.  It has improved dynamic applications, new CSS features that offer more control over your design, you can turn individual CSS properties on and off (you can see how they affect your designs), and you can fuse box model elements to troubleshoot directly within Dreamweaver.

Recently I have been trying to learn industry CSS standards and had heard that Dreamweaver has made great advances in CSS management in CS4 and CS5. Im embarrassed to say what version I am using.When I got a chance to get a reviewer copy of this training set I jumped for two reasons, first I was mulling over spending the money to upgrade to DW CS5 and I second I have always that I was missing out on a lot of DWs capabilities.  Its now obvious that I should upgrade for the CSS management upgrades alone.As for the value of the training - I couldnt be happier.  This is not an advanced tips and tricks resource, nor is it an exhaustive boot camp in web page authoring, but it is a fairly thorough training taking you from site planning and design to creation and publishing.  I watched the videos from beginning to end and they start pretty basic with an HTML refresher then move to the meatier DW specific training.  I can see myself returning to several sections later to brush up.Personally, the CSS, Media, and Forms training videos were enough to justify the price tag.  The training lessons were short and easily digestible.  I liked that it broke training into 3-10 minutes so I had some time to do a little more in-depth googling on subjects like text wrapping on absolute positioned CSS objects (which it wont.) or checking my version of DW.  What this is  - An Adobe Certification Training Aid - so it starts from a very low level introduction and  goes through the entire DW web creation process  - A wonderfully designed interface  - A great overview of using DWWhat it isnt  - A substitute for spending the time working with DW (but it will jump start a novice)  - An expert tips and tricks referenceAll in all, I highly recommend this to anyone trying to learn DW or even web design in general. The CSS placement section has been the most enlightening coverage of the topic I have been able to find.  The authors delivery on the videos is great and the interface is the best, most intuitive I have seen. The only bad thing I can say is that the closed captioning is defaulted on, so at times it covered the bottom of the properties table at the bottom of the screen. So sometimes I had to close it to see things the author was pointing out.  But all in all, this is an absolutely wonderful product.", "unixReviewTime": "1286841600"}

If you dont already know what you want to do, picking up Dreamweaver is not going to help! The product being reviewed here is how to use Dreamweaver - not how to design for the web. Both expect you already have the design part.I used a pure HTML editor, which for beginners is the best way to go. Youll learn HTML and CSS along with exactly how your code changes your page. DW is more for time savings and automation. That said, its also massively complex with a steep learning curve. And thats where Learn Adobe Dreamweaver comes in.

Feel like I know it real well, but I am still familiar with tables as opposed to CSS. So I thought this would be a great introduction, and it is. The problem is that while I am looking at the video, and that simplifies things a lot, I am not getting the intuitive explanation as to why things work the way they do. I understand just knowing how to work them is sufficient. Im tempted to delve into the rich full attributes of Dreamweaver CS5 as explained by this video, albeit difficult to understand the more advanced features, but I wont because this is about the video.The opening salvo is chock full of... for example, this is the URL; this is where you type in the address bar etc. Only when you start to get into areas such as CSS do you get an introduction that for me is beneficial, and that is only because I am somewhat of a newbie to it. So there you have it, do you get an advanced lesson that flies through things and most find it hard to understand, or do you get this one and appreciate the fact that she walks you through everything step by step, even at the risk of boring the more in the know people, but finally arriving at the section you need to learn, and then appreciate that she is not moving at lightning speed.Im holding off buying Dreamweaver CS5, although I got the upgrade to Photoshop CS5 and love it, because my MX2004 is not an eligible upgrade version. If I could qualify for the upgrade I would grab it, but the learning curve of CSS, and the steep price for the full version when I have MX2004 already is giving me some hesitation. If I was to upgrade, or should I say take the leap to the full version, this tutorial is the one I would use, and I also recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Adobe-Dreamweaver-CS5-on-Demand/dp/0789744449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 on Demand</a>&nbsp;which makes a very good reference guide.At some point I will get the new version of CS5 Dreamweaver, and at that point I will do the entire video series, and have a much more in depth analysis of it.

Candyce Mairs takes you through everything, from opening the program and setting up your desktop to creating a site. The focus is on the software, not on CSS or HTML or web design, so youll end up with a through understanding of just how the software is designed to work.The videos are brief, with clear screenshots and step by step narration which is subtitled. When occasionally the narrator makes a small error (Fireworks for Firefox, say), the subtitles correct it. The pace is slow but focused and always on task -- no rambling or making and fixing errors on screen.Since each video looks at just one issue, its very easy to find your way back if you feel confused. I like the Watch and work option, too, which lets you keep the video running in the corner of your screen so that you can work along with the video.New features of CS5 are pointed out in detail, not only in the video training but in the accompanying booklet, which also has tables of keyboard shortcuts, a glossary, and lots of example code.If youre upgrading and want to master the new features immediately or if you usually hand code and want to get to know all the timesaving features of Dreamweaver, this is exactly what you need. If youre a moderately skilled web designer and would like to increase your skills, improving your ability to use Spry, for example, this is an excellent choice.

I used Front Page for years and have created several very elementary Dreamweaver sites for family members. Im in the process of trying to work more professionally (cleaner, less, and better code) and more creatively (a less stilted and more unique and appealing design). This course doesnt purport to be a web design course, it assumes that you already have a basic idea for a (relatively simple) website and its going to teach you how to implement it. Dont expect inspiration.POSITIVE:* Level: absolute beginner to intermediate.*  It is entirely DVD-based. The booklet (106 pages including index) that comes with the DVD just provides additional random information; it is in no way connected to the content or the sequence of the course.* The scope of the information presented is all that is needed for basic competence in the implementation of a simple Dreamweaver CS5 website. You do become familiar with the DW interface; the workflow; best practices; web and DW terminology; and basic website structure and creation.* The sequence and progression is logical and sequential. There is some reiteration of basic principles as the course progresses to clarify how something previously explained applies in a new situation.* The interface is very well thought out. You can go backwards or forwards easily. It has constant access to a table of contents that allows you to search (by both topic and subtopics) in case you want to navigate to a completely different topic. It allows you to bookmark (with long notes-to-self) on topics of interest you may want to keep coming back to. The interface coloring and design are neutral and un-intrusive. The screen always retains focus and the surrounding options melt away.* The course has the secondary purpose of preparing for the Adobe Certified Expert (ACE) test. Each main section has a practice test at the end.* Another asset is that the video transcript is captioned under the viewing screen (optional). This is particularly helpful if youre in in a public place where you cant turn on the sound.* All explanations of hard-to-grasp concepts (ex: the box model) are clearly demonstrated with visual examples. As a matter of fact, this is the clearest explanation I have ever seen of the box model.* I did find the booklet section on Fireworks instructive, since I have never used that program in the past. In fact, the entire booklet is very instructive and useful--its just totally unrelated to the course on DVD.NOT SO POSITIVE:* Coverage of other concepts, such as content placement and positioning, are a little more basic and less detailed than I would have liked. I cant recall (or locate now) any reference to floats, whereas AP divs and frames (both older concepts) are well covered.* The narrator has a pleasant voice and clear diction, but is somewhat monotone and unexciting.* There is no search function or index. This makes it impossible to look up a term or a topic that is not specifically listed in the table of contents. I would have thought that the transcript text might have been searchable, but it isnt.* For my learning style, I would have preferred that the booklet function as support material for the video so I could follow along with text that directly reinforces the visual demonstration (and is easier to go back to or use as reference material.)* The bookmarks that you create when taking the course on your laptop are saved to that computer. If you want to change to your desktop, the bookmarks, obviously, are not there. So as a personal index these bookmarks have their limits.On the whole, I do recommend this course. I wish I had taken it earlier, because it laid down the groundwork better than an online course that I had just taken. However, I think that, for a person who is learning-as-you-go (not just learning general theory but actually trying to apply it to a real website) it is essential to have reference material on Dreamweaver CS5, some sort of guidance on design principles, and a solid HTML and CSS anthology--all in well-indexed books.Video and online courses teach you very well how to build their sample websites, but when you are stumped on YOUR website, you need to be able to supplement the general principles they taught you with a more on-point reference.", "unixReviewTime": "1287619200"}

Id worked through the&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Adobe-Flash-Professional-CS5-Classroom-in-a-Book/dp/0321701801/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Adobe Flash Professional CS5 Classroom in a Book</a>&nbsp;- and found that to be more comprehensive in its coverage, but there is a different emphasis here and I found I learned quite a bit that I didnt know or that wasnt clear before.  The little booklet that comes with the guide is an extremely useful introduction to design principles that are essential to effective working in Flash.There are several chapters on different introductory-level topics in Flash CS5.  Each is broken up into different sections, and usually these can be completed in under ten minutes each.  That makes this easy to work through in short sections.  You can set bookmarks to remember where you left off - although it would be nicer if the program saved your progress directly and remembered for you where you left off.  The exposition is clear, but perhaps a bit dry.  Theres no hint of humor here, and I always find it helps to make verbal lessons a bit more interesting and memorable.  Each section tells you what you are going to learn, gives you an explanation and a tutorial you can follow along using one of the project files included on the dvd, and then explains what you have learned.The focus here is on learning how things work and what things mean at a fairly basic level.  You dont get very advanced, and by the end of things youd really just have a rough idea of how things work in Flash, but it is very clear.  They assume a listener who is just getting started with Flash, and, while the lessons are sequential and they build upon each other, they remind you what youve learned and how to do things several times.  Sometimes thats a bit frustrating - in a beginners level textbook its easy just to skim through the repetition when it is familiar - with video its harder to skim through what is inessential without missing the important bits.  Thats one reason to prefer something like the Classroom in a Book series, rather than the Video Classroom approach.One thing I got here more clearly than in the Classroom in a Book for Flash CS5 is an emphasis on best practices - how to manage projects so as to be completely clear, and how that helps to achieve control over the project.  There is more explanation here - more whys behind the hows.  I thought the chapter on Action Script was excellent for giving a clear concept of how it works as an object based language - even though youd only be able to do some very rudimentary things after working through the entire chapter, youd have a pretty decent understanding of how the language works and a good basis for further learning.  There are video files on the disk that allow you to follow along on what they show you in the tutorials.  One thing they dont make clear is that to work with them you have to copy the assets folder to your hard drive and open and work with the projects there.  (I find it most convenient to backup the entire dvd to my hard drive and play it from there - since that means its available and ready whenever I want to work through a section, and it also helps to protect the original disk from scratching).Overall, its a good introduction to Flash and the emphasis on Best Practices serves as a useful complement to the how to guides you can find in other introductory Flash books.  I do have a few minor gripes:  the navigation through the chapter files is not as intuitive as Id like: there are sections and subsections, and you can go to the next section in a chapter by clicking the Next Video button.  But: when you get to the end of a subsection, the Next Video button is not enabled and you have to go back to the main index and then open up the chapter index again to get to the next section in the chapter.  Several words in the projects are misspelt (e.g. Hawaiin instead of Hawaiian), and I also noticed that at least one of the project files they encourage you to use was missing (the inverseKinematics_start.fla file from chapter 9).  Still, the guide as a whole is very helpful and clear - and the emphasis on design principles in the included booklet makes this a very helpful overview and introduction to a rich and complicated program.", "unixReviewTime": "1290816000"}

Although it does not deal with programming in detail, it does cover basic concepts of object-oriented programming, variables, conditional statements, and functions. The rest covers working with artwork and text; library and symbols; layers, timeline, animation, and tweens; working with files, sound and video. Youll learn the fundamentals; you wont learn how to create those fancy user interfaces on those fancy sites; thats for a more advanced class.As with other products in this series, there are some usability issues. At the top of the interface, theres a Previous Video button and Next Video button. The Next Video button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one youll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read Take Test instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.Theres a Watch and Work mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, youll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.All in all its a good way to get started in Flash programming, if you dont have the patience for going through a book. Know what to expect; youll learn the basics, but youll need to carry on the learning process yourself, by seeking out more advanced information or learning materials.", "unixReviewTime": "1287619200"}

In the long run, Office 365 is a better deal than buying a downloadable, installable product--because you *get* a downloadable, installable product with this deal.So what exactly are you getting here?This package is the ability to use the latest version of Office in the browser--meaning, if youre on a machine that doesnt have Office installed, you can log into your Microsoft account (required) and use browser-based versions of all the Office apps.  This also means that the online storage place called OneDrive (formerly known as SkyDrive) can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish.Its ALSO the ability to download and install Office 2013 OR Office 2016, on up to 5 machines, for up to 4 people!  Thats the cool part.  In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop.  Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wifes PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use.  Ive been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works.  2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways.This package lets you use Office for a year.  You can buy two or three and stack them to prolong your subscription (if youre afraid the price of Office will go up) or you can extend your subscription to more people (in case you have a bunch of kids and want to add mom and dad and grandma into the number of users).  I added a year using this code.  It was only easy to do because I looked online first for HOW to do it.Which brings us to the only real drawback to Office 365:  anything to do with the browser.  The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but theyre still not quite the same.  OneNote is probably the closest match Ive seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful.  The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure (the Cloud, a.k.a., on the Internet) means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.  The entire browser interface is trying to do the Kanban look that you also see in Windows 8s Metro-now-called-Modern apps and parts of Windows 10s look and feel.My rule of thumb is that the browser-based Office is for small tasks on the go, but for anything substantial I go with the PC.You also have to use the Office website to mange things like who you share Office with, or how you download.  They make it annoyingly over-complicated to download the 64-bit version of Office if you dont want to use the 32-bit.  You have to choose Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want.  Theres no good reason to bury the better-performing version that far down except that they hope it prevents tech support complications.The Home Subscription is: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and a 1TB bump-up to OneDrive, up to 4 people across 5 machines.The Personal Subscription is the same, but only for one individual user, on up to 5 machines.The Business version has a lot of other options *and* things to consider when choosing.Overall, I find this a much better deal than shelling out a few hundred dollars up front and knowing the next version will require me to buy it again, and I dont get the benefit of the added OneDrive storage space.  With this price, its cheaper and I will always have the option of downloading the latest version of Office or sticking with the one I have.  The browser-based versions I consider an afterthought, or bonus feature - I wouldnt rely solely on those for everyday work.

There are pros and cons for the user here - since its basically cloud-delivered, you dont need to worry about holding physical discs or keys; you can more easily use it on multiple devices (including Microsoft tablets - sorry iOS/Android users); you dont pay for it longer than you need it.  This model could work well for apps with specific uses that would otherwise be overly expensive, e.g. Photoshop (Adobe also rolled this SaaS plan out earlier this year to much anguish).  However, for the basic word processing, spreadsheet and presentation uses that most people look to Office for, this model could actually turn out to be more expensive in the long run.  Put another way, most people are likely using a version of Office that is many years old and thats still fine for their simple uses - that Word 2007 (or even 97!) that you purchased for perpetuity still lets you type, format and print those handful of letters that you need to create each year.  So I believe that only power users of Word, Excel and/orPowerPoint and/or homes with multiple PCs would really benefit from the SaaS pricing model.  Others will likely be frustrated when forced to fork over another $99 (unless the cost goes up, which there are no guarantees that it wont) every 12 months.  Microsoft packages some online goodies to soften this blow - Skype minutes and 20GB of online storage - but many either wont use this or will know that there are cheaper/free ways to get the same elsewhere.Installation was as straightforward as any Microsoft install.  You will need to tie it to a Microsoft online account for the cloud storage purposes.In use, I find that each subsequent version of Office gets worse in its user experience design.  I was a wiz with Office 2003, zipping through keyboard shortcuts and quickly formatting great-looking documents and presentations.  Since the new ribbon-based navigation interface in 2010, I feel that Office apps are hiding most of their functions and how to navigate through the menus/options.  Simply put, I dont feel that these newer versions of Office enable me to be as productive or creative as I had been with past versions.  I know that Im not alone in this view, but unfortunately it seems that Microsoft is more focused on their SaaS profit model and shoehorning in touch screen gimmicks (as if everyone will then run out and buy a touch-screen PC, upgrade to Windows 8, and/or grab a Surface tablet).", "unixReviewTime": "1381968000"}

But innovation as a way of creating a false impression of progress to mask a need to perpetually carve out market share is vile, and it has long driven Microsofts business plan and service model. But two other marks of Microsoft has been its attempt corner a portion of the market, give the consumer no real alternative, and then force them to pay through the nose, meanwhile making it harder and harder to use previously purchased versions of the product. And to complete my portrait of the Microsoft that I hated to like, Microsoft had an absolutely dreadful customer service department. Not that Customer Service was inept, but merely unavailable. And turning the old department store adage on its head, not only was the customer never right, they were most likely very much wrong.As a result, Microsoft had over time created a way of doing business that was out of touch with the needs of the customer. Indeed, I had come to dislike Microsoft so much that I stuck with my old copy of Office 2000 for years longer thatn I had any desire to. But I was not going to pay an absurd amount of money for a piece of software that they were only going to allow me to put onto one device, and that was not going to be supported by technical support.So imagine my shock when I found myself something of a fan of their new way of doing business. Instead of being prohibitively expensive, Office 365 is reasonably priced. You pay less than $80 for a key to unlock a download on up to five devices. Or if $80 is too pricey, you can pay just under ten dollars a month for the same five-device key. And unlike in the past, when you paid a large amount of money for a single-user key to Office Lite (the Student Edition was essentially Word and Excel, while the subscription grants you the use of more Office programs, including Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, Publisher, and One Note. What was once a prohibitively expensive suite of programs suddenly became very reasonably priced (no doubt in part because pirated editions meant that instead of paying an absurd amount of money to Microsoft, people would simply go to a Torrent site and get a free copy of Office).And to make everything even more impressive, Microsofts customer service is more accessible than ever. I had a particularly difficult installation due to preinstalled trial editions of Office 365 on my new computers. Microsoft worked with me at length to make sure Office 365 installed properly on all of my devices. Not just that, but when I expressed the wish to use my Hotmail e-mail address on Outlook, they escalated the problem to a higher level tech support person.Now, that doesnt mean that this is a perfect product. I have not liked the direction that Office has taken since Office 2007. And Microsoft still fails to include a crackerjack WYSIWYG HTML editor. But all in all Im impressed with the nontechnical aspects of Office 365. And I have to admit that it is kind of fun having at least portions of Office installed on my desktop, my lap top, my smart phone, and my tablet. In a family with multiple computer owners, it should be possible for each family member to have a full version of Office installed on their computer. Im still not a huge fan of Microsoft, but Im delighted to see them make their products more consumer-friendly.", "unixReviewTime": "1381881600"}

If you are thinking about updating your version of office this is a great thing to consider.However, many software companies are doing this rent the software idea.  I like that the Office 2007 I own is mine and I can use it for as long as I have a computer that runs it.One thing I really like about this Office version is that it contains Outlook at a somewhat reasonable price point.  I really like using Outlook at home (I have my own domain name so it is kind of a necessity for me).The whole cloud thing is concern.  There may be files that I will be willing to put there however while it may be more secure (from hackers) than my home computer the court decisions on data Ive shared with other vendors may not have as strong of legal protection as my home hard disk. (NPR did an interesting story on this)All that being said I love the idea of being able to access document that Ive been working on at home from other locations.", "unixReviewTime": "1381622400"}

One positive feature of Office 365 is the SkyDrive which enables you to save your documents and projects to the cloud and access them from other locations. I also like that 365 makes it possibly to easily collaborate on projects by inviting others to access the document. The other person does not have to have the same version of Office that you do, it can pull up the document in a browser and they can view and make changes as needed. You can also work on SkyDrive documents when youre offline and then theyll update when you have an internet connection again (BUT if the document was updated at another location and you dont have internet access, then you wont be accessing the most up-to-date version, which I view as a bit of a liability.) I have been known to save important documents to both my SkyDrive and my computer just as a back-up in case the Internet gods decide to shut up the data heavens.An added feature of Office 365 is access to Office Mobile Apps. Unfortunately, my smartphone (HTC Desire) is not compatible with the Office Mobile App and so I cant make use of the mobile features. However, the subscription does include the option of adding up to five mobile devices (but I imagine they have to be fairly recent mobile devices or you might run into the problem I had of the device being incompatible with the app). I was kind of bummed that it wont work on my device. It would have been convenient to be able to access my documents on the go, but oh well, what can you do.Installation is fairly easy. You just go to the website, enter the product key and connect it to your Microsoft account (or you can start an account with any e-mail address). It will let you download the software on up to five computers, BUT as the name Office 365 indicates, you will only have access to the software for 365 days. After that point you will have to pay all over again for another years access to the software. The positives of that is that you will always have the most up-to-date Office software (automatic updates are included in the subscription), but the obvious con is that youll be perpetually paying for a subscription. Honestly, my personal preference would be just to own the software outright (Im OK with not having the latest and greatest version). They do throw in a few extra perks to help lessen the pain of an annual subscription: Skype 60 minutes a month world calling & SkyDrive with 20 GB storage.It did take a little while for the program to download, but if you have any experience with Office products, it is pretty easy to find your way around. I do like that you have the option of downloading on up to five computers and five mobile devices, but you do have to be prepared to repay for the right to access the software annually. If youre OK with that, then I think youll enjoy Office 365. Its user-friendly and helps bring accessible technology to our society thats increasingly mobile and connected. I like that my documents can go with me wherever I am.", "unixReviewTime": "1381190400"}

It wasnt always this way, as those who have been computer users for some years will remember well. In fact, we may have all been running WordPerfect Office with its affiliated programs if it wasnt for some strange twists in computer history beginning in the 1990s.There are a number of variations of this Microsoft Office suite that can be found here, but this review is specifically focused on&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Office 365 Home Premium</a>. This version is is a one-year subscription downloaded from Net by entering a product key card, and is licensed for up to five users on PCs, Windows 8 tablets, and Macs (with some limitations - see the specs). It offers the current versions of Word, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher, Access and more.Please note: I had previously installed the&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Office-Home-Business-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPWJ98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Office Home & Business 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version on a Window 7 PC notebook, and that version had worked quite well. The annual subscription to Office 365 Home Premium became a worthy option for a new PC running Windows 8 as a development/test system for both hardware and software, so when it came to making a decision as to which suite to go with, curiosity won out.Here are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office 365 Home Premium suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details. Likes:+ Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless+ Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed+ Operates on five PCs or Macs; license for single household with multiple users+ Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook.com, Gmail and private email+ SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed+ Easy customization once installed; make it work your way Rants & Irritants:- Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; dont like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat Installation:The setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then its a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.Found the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Publisher, youll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.What follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office 365 Home Premium suite. I wont attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use. SkyDrive:I like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office 365 Home Premium, and has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office 365 saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once youre logged in. Word:The features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that Ive found working on clients Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.Among the new additions that Ive found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style. Excel:On a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that Ive used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.But now theres a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, such as (212) 555-1212, and restore the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. Its well worth it. OneNote:This is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files. PowerPoint:Theres a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler. Outlook:Theres an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. Ive been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. Im currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible. Publisher:I personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office 365, youll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document. Access:The Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have not accessed this module, and pardon the pun. Annoyances & Irritants:My primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and Im trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if Ill change it. As noted earlier, I dont like the new Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. Its essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them. Suggestions:Putting this simply, if youre happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. My decision to try Office 365 was based on the fact that it was going to be a clean install on a new Windows 8 PC and that I had a year to use it and see if it was worth the subscription, or if it might be better to go with a regular license for another version. My installation went smoothly and it works well; your results may differ from mine.I have not tried an installation on a Windows 7 PC to date, but have been largely impressed with how well it runs on a standard, out-of-the-box Windows 8 PC. Please note: this review will be dynamic in that as I find experiences worth sharing, be they pro or con, they will be appended to this review. Other findings or additional resources may be listed in the comments.

Please keep in mind that with such a program, your needs and mine may differ, as we each use such office suites in different fashions.

Considering the fact that I probably go through a primary PC for work about once every two years, the price point of the Key Card was very attractive to me.As far as the software itself, the tweaks took a little getting used to, as always; but, after using them for a while now, I definitely prefer the new Word and Excel to their predecessors. Of course, there will always be some things that can be done without, like having to select a new page, or blank workbook from among templates every time the program is opened, or the cutesy graphics around the borders of the applications.Office is still a five star product in my book.

This version contains Word for word processing, Excel for spreadsheets, PowerPoint for presentations, OneNote to help keep you and projects organized, and Outlook to manage your email.  This is the version that can be installed on up to five devices and is only valid for a one year subscription.  Im not a fan of this type of subscription, but the cost is lower than buying the one pc version, and this can be used on windows tablets and phones, as well.  Its just a matter of determining how you will use this software and deciding which version is right for you.  For those who prefer cloud storage, 27GB on MS SkyDrive is included with this subscription.  This means you can log in from any pc and access the documents you have stored there. (like google drive)  Although, I have not used this feature, the documentation states that you receive 60 minutes per month of Skype international calling.  If you are updating from Office 2007 or 2010, you shouldnt have too much of a learning curve.  The change from Office 2003 (if you are still using that version) is pretty drastic, though.  There are many tutorials on the MS website to help you along.  Ive used this software for years, and recommend it highly.

As long as an account is setup before trying to downloading the product, it downloaded and installed easily for me. Yes, it took time. After all, this is a bloated Microsoft product. This version of Office is sort of a hybrid, or so it feels - partly in the cloud, but mostly on your computer. That it good for people on the go and need to access documents that may have been saved at different locations on different machines or devices. Documents can be saved to the Skydrive associated with your account. In order to use this program, unlike a standard office version, you must be logged into the account you created, or a previous account that can be linked to the subscription. The subscription includes free apps (must be downloaded from the app stores) for iPhone and I would imagine Android and Windows mobile as well, which allow viewing and editing documents as well as accessing the Skydrive from a mobile device (Dont tell the boss about this).The new look of Office 365 is more in line with Windows 8, but it is flat, colorless and dull. Microsoft does not give you many options to change it either. There are three different themes to choose from - White, Light Gray and Dark Gray. Wow! Microsoft really? I would at least have expected a light blue like Office 2007 offered. At least if White or Light Gray is chosen there is a thin line of color at the bottom status bar, with dark gray chosen this is black. The color changes based on the program being used - blue for Word, green for Excel, etc. There is also a background pattern that can be chosen which is really just in the top right hand corner of the screen. These uninteresting patterns are grey, but vary in shade based on the theme chosen. Pretty unexciting.As far as functionality goes, Office hasnt changed that much in the last few versions, there is a customizable ribbon at the top which changes based on the tab that is chosen. Microsoft has done away with any sort of shading or shadowing to make the ribbon stand out in any way, it is incredibly flat looking, which is kind of disconcerting, and at times confusing. Clicking on File (which for some reason always has a colored box around it) slides open another screen where there are other options. This is where more of a Windows 8 look comes into play (and a little bit more color). The options are pretty much the same as in other Windows versions, just presented differently. Save As offers an option to save to the computer as well as to the Skydrive. Microsoft installs a program that loads when the computer is started that keeps the Skydrive in sync with all the documents saved there. The icon in the computers toolbar is a cloud with a green line moving from left to right. Because it is constantly synching, there is a noticeable, but not intolerable lag when typing, as compared to a non-cloud based system.Office 365 comes with a license for up to 5 PCs or Macs which makes the $99.00 a year (at time the of review) price a good deal if utilizing all of them, since it offers the full Office suite, 20 GB storage on the Skydrive and 60 minutes of Skype per month all included in the subscription. It does not turn out to be such a good deal if it is only being used on one PC or Mac, in which case it might be better to get a non-subscription version which costs more upfront, but can be used until its obsolescence at no charge. The other versions offer the same features without the Skype credits and less storage space on the Skydrive. Windows 7 or 8 is required to run any new version of Microsoft Office product.Microsoft Office is pretty much the world standard for software of this type. Other software has come and gone, so it is almost essential to own some version of Office these days. While Office 365 is not my favorite version that Microsoft has created, its not that bad either. The lack of color makes their product boring and hard to navigate, and because there is no option to change this is frustrating. Microsoft needs to put some style into its office products.", "unixReviewTime": "1380240000"}

There are lenses that distribute content over a zoomable interface, media containers, a results grid, basic and advanced searches, menus, and a link to online tutorials.  All of these are explained in the help menu with visuals to assist the user.++  Glo has added online tutorials for those who would like an overview prior to either purchasing or using the software.++  The user can check out the contributors and sources on the company website.  I did notice that when I clicked on information on Syria I was taken to an Wikipedia article on the web.++  There is a Quick Install option (I didnt opt to use this one) and an uninstall option on your control panel.++  When you start glo up it will immediately look for updates, something that most people will appreciate as it will keep your information from becoming dated or obsolete.++ You can install glo on five personal devices,including PC, Mac, iPhone and iPad.The only thing I didnt find was a user manual, something that I would have appreciated as would many other users.  Sometimes a user manual is greatly appreciated by those who are a little less high tech.  I cant fault glo as they are selling software and not manuals, but it would have been a nice touch.  With all the nice additions, Ill give a little bit of information on what you are getting.  If you already know you want this software, you can simply bypass the rest of this review.  In this revolutionary new Bible (NIV study Bible) youll find an an amazing array of all aspects of Biblical lore from the historical aspects, to spirituality, the arts, and many more factual aspects you can weave into your own life and studies.GLO features:++  450+ Virtual Tours  These are 360-degree tours of modern-day and re-created ancient biblical locations.++  3.5 Hours of HD Videos  Youll be able to enjoy the In His Shoes HD interactive documentary.++  2,300+ High Resolution Photos  The zoom feature is a real plus when you want to look more closely at a photograph.++  7,500+ Articles  The large variety of articles will help you as you create your own Bible reading planTake for example when I wanted to take a look at Syria.  There was a columnar format that presented the information GLO had to offer provided I wanted to explore its relation to the Bible in my readings.  I was offered thirty-three scripture references, one internal article, twelve maps, and one web article.++  650+ Works of Art++  Integration with the best web content++  Continual additions to the content each time you load the program++  Concise, compact organization through five lenses++  You have the ability to journal and take notes as you studyLENSES:BIBLE:  You can easily navigate and find the verse or chapter you want easily.TIMELINE:  You can compare and contrast when many events occurred through time starting with the CreationMyGlo:  This is where you will house all your notes, journal, bookmarks, and reading plans.MEDIA:  This area houses the videos, thousands of articles, photographs, artwork, maps, virtual tours, and more.ATLAS:  This is a zoomable atlas where you can see the larger picture or zoom in to see a particular area of interest.TOPICAL:  Here you can quickly find relevant verses and articles on thousands of key concepts.There are three DVDs in this packet.

If you simply browse someone elses program youll certainly want to have a copy as it brings out the wow factor.  The one thing to keep in mind is that it does use the NIV version of the Bible by Biblica (copyright 1984), Zondervan, as I realize this is not the version of choice by all people.  If you want to create and tailor your own Bible reading plan in a new, innovative way, this is one program you will probably enjoy tremendously.", "unixReviewTime": "1306886400"}

From my perspective, I have taken a lot of time to get used to the interface and explore the features.  As somebody who is admittedly not an expert in the subject matter, I find the interactive features to add new dimensions to the content that is presented.  And considering the amount of investment required to produce software of this caliber, I think this program is a great value.Many have reported installation problems.  For PC use, I can report that I had no problems installing this on Windows 7.  The program required that I install Microsoft .NET framework 4 first, and the related updates.  But as of November 2011, it seems like some of the installation problems have been fixed.The initial install allows you to access the basic features, but you will need to register to use things like the Atlas.  The actual space required to install the software is about 1 GB for a PC and 200 MB for a Mac.  You can use the interface to stream the data off the internet, and while there is some lag it wasnt significant for me.  But yes, if you want all the files on your local hard drive you will need to use all 3 disks and it will take up about 18 GBs.  That seems like a small price to pay for those who choose to have all the content stored locally.This product is advertised to work for multiple devices.  While I had no problem with a PC install, it seems getting it to work on a tablet or iPod requires separate installs.  I will update this further once I confirm that my license key works for all the devices.The best features for me are the Atlas, which integrates historical content from the Bible with geographical data and images.  This is the kind of resource that I think would be very valuable when visiting the various regions of Europe, Africa and the Middle East depicted in the Bible.CONCLUSIONThis is a very good program.  Though it takes some time to learn the interface, I think its worth the effort.  Enjoy.", "unixReviewTime": "1306800000"}

I enjoy reading the Bible for its historical information and have found over the years many different iterations of the Bible.  GLO, however, is the best collection of information not only pertaining directly to the written words contained in the King James Version and for many others.  There is nothing quite as pleasant as sitting in front of a monitor and just going from verse to verse but having those verses explained in a way the layman can fully understand some of the background.  For comparison I have a 1810 version of The King James Bible that has been passed down from several generations and is quite used.  The words, however, come through and are the same.  The annotations for each page, where applicable, are similar to GLOs annotations except the time in years actually makes a difference.  Thats a good thing and GLO does it well.  I was not prepared for the full range of information contained in the program and even though it slows the speed of my computer it is well worth the small wait.  There are hundreds of meaningful pictures coupled with historical facts and comparisons.  I have found that reading the Bible is significantly rewarding and far better than listening to it on a recording.

Gorgeous graphics, a unique interface, beautiful easy-on-the eyes bible pages, and so much more its overwhelming. You can go from casual reading to in-depth historical research with a few clicks. Theres so much to GLO...Im still discovering stuff about it.GLO at its base offers the bible in five versions, an atlas, a timeline, topical, media, and a place for your stuff. Reading the bible on GLO is a joy. The pages are laid out beautifully - like a book displayed on a screen. Makes it easy to read. In the bottom you can view commentaries or add your own notes. You can also see notes that other have made via YouVersion. (Nice feature!) Also, it will display any media (video, pics, and more) that may be relevant to the part of the bible youre reading. If you right-click on bible passages, another sub-menu appears to copy it or take your study further.GLOs gorgeous screens reminds me Linux Ubuntus darkly colorful Unity interface mixed with Apples love of icons all in a unique interface package. Icons glow and grow, screens slide, all on a black background - except for when youre reading the bible. Your work sessions are recorded as icons you can return to. The different parts of the menu and program options are accessed on sliding tabs and icons. This is not a flat bible program - its a 3D bible world that you are navigating through. Is visually exciting, but the possibility to get lost or wander is too easy as well.Be forwarned: you do need a very capable computer with a good amount of processing power. GLO is graphically intensive. Icons glow and fade, the background shifts, something is always moving making it visually exciting. However, I dont doubt this will tax some older computers graphics capabilities. Make sure you have the minimum requirements (hopefully more) so you can enjoy this program for how it is created.The one thing that annoys me to pieces is that I really dont know how to process all this information. I have a fully loaded and gorgeous program and no skills to how to use it to my benefit. I wish GLO had included a follow-along tutorial explaining all the different features, how they work together, and the different ways I can benefit from it. I did see a short video trailer about GLO and it just affirmed that theres so much that can be done with this program that I havent conceived yet.Im also disappointed that there isnt a Strongs concordance or similar (or at least I havent found it yet) to do word research on the Greek or Hebrew meaning. Thats so automatic with so many other bible programs its surprising not to find it with this one.GLO is quite frankly mind-boggling! It offers so much that you are pretty much blown away. It offers a stunningly beautiful interface and a tons of information and resources to draw from. It also offers the ability to link your information to an iPhone/iPad app so you can carry it around with you. The only drawback is that you do need a rather powerful computer to get the most out of it without lag or frustration. I also believe a tutorial is would have been sorely helpful so you get the most bang for you buck rather than just wandering around.", "unixReviewTime": "1314230400"}

If I ever become an owner of a tablet, IPod Touch or IPad, I plan on downloading the Glo Bible IPad app & syncing my notes and/or bookmarks to the device.

I needed to use Help to learn how to find my way around.As a test,  I did a search for Galatians 5:22; first it turned up nothing, but then I did a search in Galatians & also on the home page both searches pulled up the verse, 2 photos and a map. Clicking on the verse took me to the Galations 5,  the highlighted Bible passage, study notes and a map. Clicking the photos brought up the photo, its description and other pertinent info.  Clicking on the map brought up even more information.

To make this program perfect & even more useful to me, Id like to see the following added:Audible dictionary; Id like to be able to click on a word, go to the definition & also hear how its pronounced.A few more Bible versions; currently it has NIV 1984 & 2010, KJV, The Message & ESV. Id like to see NLT added. Id also like the Bible versions in parallel format so I could read the same passage in different versions side-by-side.I wish the Bible timeline also showed the events happening in world history.And, I  wish the Life Application Notes were included.In my opinion, adding these items would make this software perfect!This program is huge with many, many interactive features; it can be overwhelming. Take your time, dont feel intimidated & soon youll be comfortable with the wealth of information found in Glo Premium.UPDATE: I recently recd an IPod Touch & added the Glo Bible App; now I have Glo Premium on my IPod Touch, it syncs with the program on my laptop.

Nolo makes (made) some valuable applications but they tend to look like something you would find in MSDOS 3.0.  Quicken, on the other hand has a very slick and easy to understand user interface.WillMaker Plus is very much a Nolo product. Although it contains the basic forms you buy it for, the user interface is so basic it looks like something you would find on PCs from the 1980s.  The willmaking app (the part that most people buy this for) consists of 7 questions.  Seriously, thats it. You are allowed to enter only what the software will let you enter and there are some really basic non-interactive guidelines that are at the same time too basic and also too confusing.I wrote my own will in about 10 minutes, but the software didnt permit me to include ANY specific details for someone to know what my final intentions are. I cant imagine anyone having such a basic lifestyle as to just say give it all to so-and-so.  I think anyone could just hand-write that sort of thing on a piece of paper and hand it to their next of kin.  I expected the software to be more like TurboTax in that it would interview me about what the provisions of my mortgage are, what and where my investments are, what and where my life insurance policies are, what I owe and how to pay that off, what special provisions I may have for friends who are not in my will but who I may want to leave certain things that theyve admired to.  But no.  None of the above.  Just 7 questions and a print-out of something that to me really has no practical value.I think Quicken is doing themselves a disservice to put their name on this product. Its not worth the 35 bucks and especially not worth the list price of 70. There are hundreds of websites you can go to and download a simple will form that will be just as useful to you as WillMaker Plus.

Unfortunately, starting with the 2010 version, Nolo, the publisher of self-help legal books that produces this software, took away the living trust feature, which was a terrible move.  (Also, youre supposed to upgrade to a new version *every year*.  If you dont, the software wont update itself after the end of the version year -- i.e., Dec. 31, 2011 for the 2011 version -- which can cause problems as states [such as New York] do update their probate and other estate-related laws.)This 2011 version does not come with the living trust feature, either, but does provide you with a link upon installation to access Nolos online living trust product for free. This was probably in response to the uproar from their loyal customer base last year. While this does mitigate the problem somewhat -- living trusts are an essential part of estate planning for most people and must be included in an estate toolkit -- it means none of the information you enter in Willmaker Plus 2011, such as all the contact names and addresses and birthdays and phone numbers, carries over to the living trust part, essentially making you have to enter all that information again.Other than that, both the Willmaker itself and the online living trust software are solid estate planning products.  Of course, tools like this are best for simple situations.  How simple?  For example, in my case Id like to attach a condition to my will that the people Id like to be the personal custodians for my kids only become custodians if they relocate to my city.  It turns out I cannot do this in Willmaker.  What I have to do is go through the standard Q&A process of Willmaker, export the draft to Word, and then add the condition in Word myself.  This part is easy; the hard -- real hard -- part is I now need to pore over my states will law to make sure my language is kosher.  I already know the condition itself is fine; I just have to make sure the way I write it -- since Willmaker didnt write it for me -- will pass on probate.For most families without complicated familial situations -- such as history of multiple divorces and remarriages or estranged children -- Willmaker Plus 2011 will be good for making wills, living wills (aka healthcare directives), powers of attorney, etc.  You can also write promissory notes and some other simple legal documents beyond wills.Another thing Im disappointed with Nolo and this version -- again I think Nolo is using the product as a cash cow rather than to really help its customers -- is its little changed from the 2009 version, or even the earlier version I had used before.  The same typos (yes, TYPOS!) remain, and the same interface remains.  It seems every year they just change the update-expiration date of the program and the splash screen, and then sell it as a new version.  (And the price seems to have been going up, even though now it doesnt come with living trusts built-in.)  I find this practice unethical.Most likely this will be the last version of Willmaker Ill use.  I wasnt going to use the 2011 version, but got a chance to try it for free, hence I used it and this review.  Therere books out there that show you step-by-step how to make wills and living trusts, books published by Nolo and by big-name publishers.  But in the end, I think next time I modify my will or living trust, Im going to see an estate lawyer -- there are a few reasonable-cost ones in my community.", "unixReviewTime": "1310169600"}

Confusion was the only consistent theme in this application.  Put out by Quicken, the documents are actually created by Nolo, which is a trusted source of legal information.  Id suggest buying their books instead.The program includes sections on: Buying or Selling a Business; Contracts for Goods and Services; Corporate Minutes and Consents; Forming a Business; Hiring Workers; Leasing Space; LLC Minutes and Consents; Managing Finances; Buying and Selling Real Estate; and Tax Forms.In these sections, instead of giving you a handy Microsoft Word Document that you can fill in obvious blanks on, the program makes you go through a step by step interview and often doesnt remember the information you enter from one form to another so you must enter your name, the name of the business and so forth all over again.  Nor does it integrate with any contact managers so you can easily fill in from there.  When your interview is complete, the document saves only in text or RTF format, which are highly compatible with most programs but at this point, .doc is pretty standard.Many of the items in these sections are simply Adobe Acrobat forms without the ability to edit or annotate them unless you have something besides Acrobat reader.Included in the program are checklists  that are very short guides on very weighty subjects such as How to Form an LLC and How to Set Up Tax Reporting and Accounting.  All these checklists do though is point you to other Nolo books or websites and are unable to offer any advice in and of themselves.  In other words, pretty much worthless.Most frustrating to me was the business library which were simple PDFs (or Windows antiquated Book Reader format of:  Starting & Running a Small Business; Tax Savvy for Small Business; The Managers Legal Handbook; How to Write a Business Plan; and Business Loans From Family and Friends.  Unfortunately, these books were previous versions and the newest versions of these books (despite the 2011 in the title of the program) are available elsewhere.Additionally, also included with the program is a printed book called Your Little Legal Companion that has absolutely nothing to do with business and contains basic personal legal information that borders on the silly such as Moving in with your Lover and Getting Old. These tidbits of advice had little substantive or legal value and were more like a sidebar from a Sunday newspaper magazine than anything that could be used for real reference or planning.Upon registering the book, Nolo will send you a PDF of their book 101 Law Forms for Personal Use.  Again, this is just a PDF and not any templates that can actually be used within a program.Combined together the program is a good value for all that you are getting.

(Today, the price is just $26 for the updated version)That said, I have not looked at the 2012 version, but it claims to have everything the old version has plus more. So Ill go ahead and comment on the old version weve used:First, most (probably all) of these forms can be found online for free. The real estate & leasing contracts, for example, can be found on your state realtors web site, or your states bar association web site. Contracts for goods & services can be found on your state web site (department of motor vehicles for a bill of sale for a car, etc). But if youre like me and dont have time to browse, surf & download, here they are offered on one disc for a pretty reasonable price.I will also add, most of these forms are what you see on Nolo.com, usually on sale for $15-$20 each. So if youve ever downloaded a form or contract from Nolo, you can get a couple hundred forms here for the price of 2. They claim this contains $900 worth of forms (real estate & leases, bill of sale, service contract & invoicing, paperwork for hiring employees, corporate minutes, IRS tax forms, sample forms for corporate policies, and a few more).All of that said, this is nowhere near exhaustive - if you are run a fairly straightforward service or contracting business, or are a sole proprietor, this might meet many of your needs. But if you have a corporation (even an LLC), this software is insufficient.I dont really agree with the reviewers who say this will save you legal fees - I dont know anyone who hires a lawyer to write such simple forms. There is nothing here that saved us any legal fees.Also, none of the forms were usable as-is for me. Fortunately they can be customized, but I ended up adding huge addendums to any form I used. And, most of these forms are very common, we already had form letters on the computer for most of these topics (we store form letters online for free on our Google Docs account - saves file space, never worry about a crashed hard drive, and any employee can access & download a blank form from anywhere in the world, for free).Nonetheless I still give this 3.5 to 4 stars. For me, its all about saving time. There were a few useful things on here, which saved me an hour or two, so its not perfect but it deserves a decent rating.", "unixReviewTime": "1327536000"}

Originally sold only by subscription many homes treasured the magazines carefully preserving them in bookcases.  This set provides all the issues from 1888 to 2008, 120 years, in one small box.

Note that this copy process is rather slow (if you have more than one DVD drive you can do more than one copy at the same time) and the data are stored in inividual image files for each page so it has to copy around 34,000 files per disk. Each file copy seems to cause the DVD drive to seek back and forth across the disk once, which means 34,000 seeks per disk which slows the process significantly (to over an hour per disk) and also might result in a significant amount of wear and tear on the DVD drive (this is speculation).Note that youll need 50GB of available disk space if you choose to install all the data to disk!The developers are actively updating the program and the latest Mac version has a copy everything to disk feature which does the work for you, and the Windows version should have this same function enabled literally any day now.

The cost alone makes it a nearly risk free purchase.  Will it make you fluent?  No it wont, but Im seeing it for a low price with free shipping.  What have you got to lose?  I cant comment on how it compares to Rosetta  Stone,  but just their Level 1 alone is 5 x the $s.The program CDs focus on teaching words and basic phrases, these are OK, but really dont get too in depth with what you need to know to really learn Spanish.  The real guts of the course is what they call the Mp3/iPod Audio Disk.  This is where they go over verb conjugation and such, basically the rules of Spanish.  There isnt any pretty interface, but I found this one CD alone worth the purchase price.The Who is Oscar Lake CD game is really lame.  They could have just omitted it.  As I said, the other GUI CDs are OK, and worth going through for the most part.  The Level 1 Disk 2 CD looks like it was left over from the 90s.  I really didnt get too much out of it and it did appear to be information that was covered elsewhere.  There are several different looks to the CDs, so it really looks like they have just bundled programs that they compiled over the years.  I also noticed that some of the translations are not 100% accurate.  For instance, the Spanish phrasing would obviously contain the words Madrid or Barcelona, but the English translations would not.  This kind of made me wonder why.Based primarily of the price point, I do recommend this program as a starting point for learning Spanish.  There are many other free resources online that you can use to supplement the course including translators, traveler cheat sheets and so on.", "unixReviewTime": "1302480000"}

After doing my homework, I finally decided to invest in this product.Many people complain about the teaching method of this software but I think the problem is that many people are comparing this economically priced software with foreign language learning software that costs several hundred dollars.  If the price of this software were several hundred dollars, I would have probably only given it 1 star. But this software does not cost several hundred dollars and happens to be one of the most economically priced software programs available for learning a foreign language. At the very least, this software will teach you how to say and recognize a few hundred words. For that reason, I must give this software at least 4 stars.Without a doubt, what I like most about this program is that it has lots of Spanish lessons at a very good price. The first level consists of 2 CDs that cover a lot of basic words and phrases that are helpful to know. And the second level also has 2 CDs that build on the words and phrases covered in Level 1 by giving the learner the tools to put together increasingly more complex sentences while ensuring that you are also learning proper pronunciation.  I found that the second level taught enough so that at the completion of the second level, the student should be able to string together basic phrase or sentences in order to converse about members of the family, sports, etc.The third level which consisted of two CDs as well was my favorite level because it was the most challenging which is ideal for me because  I have been studying Spanish for quite a while. The actual conversations in the third level were a lot more challenging for me than the single vocabulary words covered in level 1 and the basic phrases covered in level 2. The third level also helped to reinforce what I learned in the other lessons.There is a bonus CD with a game that comes with Immersion Spanish called Oscar On The Lake which I did not find fun at all.  I could have easily done without the Oscar On The Lake game. In fact, I dont see what was the point in including this Oscar On The Lake game with the program.But I did find that the audio CD was very helpful. The audio CD thoroughly covered the alphabet, greetings, pronouns (including vosotros) conjugating AR, ER, and IR verbs, weather, numbers, and vocabulary for shopping and at the post office. What I liked most about the audio CD is that the instructor gave a lot grammatical explanations  including when the vos (as opposed to vosotros) is used instead of the tu form.One of the bonuses that I received with my Immersion Spanish software was in interactive DVD with Spanish learning games for the whole family. The DVD is can be used on the TV.  But I havent had a chance to use the DVD because the 3 Levels consisting of 6 CDs and the audio CD, have enough to keep me busy for a quite a while.  One feature about Immersion Spanish the appeals to me is that the software can be used by both children and adults who want to learn Spanish.  Based on the products price and the content, I recommend it.Some other products that I recommend for Spanish language learners are Visual Link Spanish. This is a great  learning Spanish software program for the visual learner. Before I discovered&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Visual-Link-Spanish-Level-I/dp/B0000C08KK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Visual Link Spanish - Level I</a>, in all of my reviews I used to recommend Rosetta software. But after using Visual Link, it is clear to me that this software is a much better alternative for the visual learner. If you do not consider  yourself a visual learner, then&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Fluenz-Version-F2-Spanish-1-2-3-4-5-with-supplemental-Audio-CDs-and-Podcasts/dp/B002ZF31NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Fluenz Version F2: Spanish 1+2+3+4+5 with supplemental Audio CDs and Podcasts</a>&nbsp;is probably the way to go.To speak Spanish fluently besides having a stand alone course as your base and a method to learn new Spanish words, you will also need to master conjugating Spanish verbs. The best product for that is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Verbarrator-Version-1-1-Windows-Version/dp/B002EADP1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)</a>&nbsp;software. The Verbarrator software does a great job of replacing the boring Spanish verb conjugation books and makes learning Spanish verbs enough fun that you will want to use the software every day. And the more you use the tool the quicker that you will learn how to conjugate Spanish verbs and reach fluency. The Verbarrator is probably the best investment that I have made in my journey to learn Spanish because it is a product that I use almost daily.The last product that I recommend for anyone who is really serious about learning Spanish is&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/The-Ultimate-Spanish-Review-and-Practice-w-CD-ROM-UItimate-Review-Reference-Series/dp/0071492151/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice w/CD-ROM (UItimate Review & Reference Series)</a>.

WAY more interesting than just having a book or a cassette.  I would hardly call it immersion, however, unless they sent several Spanish-speaking people to your house along with the program!

Learning a new language or brushing up on your existing skill is tricky business. I learned a lot of Japanese learning in Japan, but its not always possible to just go to a country to cement or start your language skills so I picked up the Spanish version. The largest problem I am having the the Instant Immersion series (in general) is they dont seem to update anything. Ive used the Japanese version in the past, and got ahold of this Spanish version. The graphics are dated and unattractive. The videos/animation slow and not fluid. This looks like they took the same product theyve been peddling for years and updated the installation programs and little else which is unfortunate. I understand a product like this wants to be low profile so it can install on even the oldest computers still running (and many of those old computers are still more than enough for average users), but I just find this method cheap and unappealing. That sounds are still hollow sounding as well and modern day clip-art looks more attractive. The games/learning tools are the same but not expanded. It doesnt look like they added new words or addressed much new material at all.I still think these are interesting to start with if you dont have an old version.

You get a lot with this set but the quality of the content varies greatly from disc to disc. The program includes, in recommended order of use:1) An MP3 Audio CD - This teaches the basic vocabulary and phrases. It can also be downloaded onto an iPod.The main learning programs follow and need to be installed to run. These include lessons, games, and allow for downloading elements to an iPod -2) Level 1, Disc 1 (Talk Now) CD-ROM3) Level 1, Disc 2 (Vocabulary Builder) CD-ROM4) Level 2, Disc 1 (Talk More) CD-ROM5) Level 2, Disc 2 (Talk the Talk) CD-ROM6) Level 3, Disc 1 (World Talk) CD-ROM7) Level 3, Disc 2 (Business Talk) CD-ROM8) Talk More Interactive DVD - This is basically an overview that includes basic phrases and quizzes, but is hard to navigate9) Who is Oscar Lake CD-ROM Game - This is an actual PC game that plays like one of the popular mystery games (i.e. Nancy Drew, etc)The Audio CD and PC Game feel like they were added as extras since they dont really match the rest of the class.I deducted rating stars because of the clumsy feel of the games, the user recording without verification (something other programs support), and lack of a cohesive lesson plan.I had two years of Spanish in High School (almost 30 years ago), so this program was a much needed refresher. In addition, my daughter has just finished her 3rd year of High School Spanish and she went through some of the program (and game play) with me. We both agree that while this program (and likely those similar to it) will teach you the basic words and phrases, nothing will let you develop and retain a second language unless you actually use it with native speakers on a regular basis.This program does give you a lot for the price so it is a good value but as another reviewer points out, learning another language is harder as you get older!

It would also be a good companion product if you were taking a Spanish class or using a more comprehensive Spanish course product. Since I dont speak Spanish, I think Im a good test subject. Heres what I liked and didnt like about this course:I received the product as a Vine Voices item to review, but if I were to buy it, the price is reasonable for the amount of material you receive. There are 9 disc included, with lessons, in levels 1, 2 and 3, an Oscar Lake game, one disc that includes phrases in everyday language, and to perfect your pronunciation. Theres also a disc that you can transfer to an MP3 player and carry with you. I didnt like that its necessary to insert the discs in your computer in order to use the program, other than the one MP3 disc that I just mentioned. So if youre traveling, its extra materials to carry around. It would have been nice to be able to just load them on a laptop. With a netbook, most which come without CD drives, this would have been even more of a problem.There were a lot of lessons with phrases and some with sentences, but it was difficult without much knowledge of the language to figure out what some of the individual words meant. Many times I was guessing. It was nice to have all the photos and video of people talking, or at least of their mouths moving. I liked that they used both male and female voices and that they repeated phrases and sentences twice in most cases. Ive learned numbers and some phrases, but I would have a difficult time putting together a sentence on the basis of what Ive learned with this course. Different verb tenses which are important to learning a language werent covered in a meaningful way. The MP3/iPod audio disc was useful, as far as it went, carried some information on verb tenses, but just not enough that I had enough understanding beyond the phrases covered.Im not sure how this program compares to Rosetta Stone because its been at least 12 years since Ive tried Rosetta Stone and in a different language than this and Im sure there have been many changes in the program over the years.If you need a companion course to a class youre taking or to a more comprehensive course I think this would be an great way to supplement that.

The rate of innovation in the last five versions was impressive and welcome. It continues apace in this rendition with Britannica Biographies (Great Minds, Heroes and Villains, and Leaders), Classical Music (500 audio files arranged by composer), and a great Workspace for Project Management (a kind of friendly digital den). Six months of free access to the myriad riches of the Britannica Online complete the package (as well as monthly updates and discounts on a plethora of products).The Britannica comes bundled with an atlas (close to 1800 maps linked to articles and 287 World Data Profiles of individual countries and territories); the Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Thesaurus, augmented by a Spanish-English translation dictionary; classic articles from previous editions; thirteen yearbooks (12,200 articles in total); Interactive Timelines with 4000+ indexed timeline entries; a Research Organizer; and a Knowledge Navigator (called The Brain or BrainStormer). All told, it offers a directory of more than 166,000 reviewed and vetted links to online content.In its new form the Britannica is user-friendly, with an A to Z Quick Search feature. The Britannicas newest interface is even more intuitive and uncluttered than previously and is great fun to use. It offers morsels of knowledge, some of it date-specific, appetizingly presented through a ticker tape of visuals that leisurely scrolls across the bottom of the screen plus highly edifying interactive tours of articles and attendant media.When you enter even the first few letters of a term in the search box, it offers various options and is persistent: no need to click on the toolbars search button every time you want to find something in this vast storehouse of knowledge. Moreover, the user can save search results onto handy Virtual Notecards. Whole articles can be copied onto the seemingly inexhaustible Workspace.The new Britannicas display is tab-based, avoiding the erstwhile confusing proliferation of windows with every move. Most importantly, articles appear in full, not in sections. This major improvement facilitates the finding of relevant keywords in and the printing of entire texts. These are only a few of the numerous alterations and enhancements.Perhaps the most refreshing change is the Britannicas Update Center. Dozens of monthly updates and new, timely articles are made available online (subject to free registration). A special button alerts the user when an entry in the base product has been updated.Regrettably, the updates are not incorporated into the vast encyclopedia and its search interface: they are out there on a website. Moreover, the product does not alert its user to the existence of completely new articles, only to updated ones. It takes a manual scan of the monthly lists to reveal newly added content.Speaking of updates, one must not forget to dwell on the Britannicas unequalled yearbooks. Each annual volume contains the year in events, scientific developments, and everything you wanted to know about the latest in any and every conceivable field of human endeavor, or Nature. About 12,200 articles culled from the last 13 editions buttress and update the Encyclopedias anyhow impressive offerings.The Britannica provides considerably more text than any other extant traditional encyclopedia, print or digital (a total of 62 million words). But it has noticeably enhanced its non-textual content over the years (the 1994-7 editions had nothing or very little but words, words, and more words): it now boasts in excess of 30,000 images and illustrations (depending on the version) and 900 video and audio clips. This is not to mention the Britannica Classics: articles from Britannicas most famous contributors: from Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein to Harry Houdini and from Marie Curie to Orville Wright.The Britannica fully supports serious research. It is a sober assemblage of first-rate essays, up to date bibliographies, and relevant multimedia. It constitutes a desktop university library: thorough, well-researched, comprehensive, trustworthy.The Britannicas 84-107,000 articles (depending on the version) are long and thorough, supported by impressive bibliographies, and written by the best scholars in their respective fields. The companys Editorial Board of Advisors reads like the whos who of the global intellectual and scientific community.The Britannica is an embarrassment of riches. Users often find the wealth and breadth of information daunting and data mining is fast becoming an art form. This is why the Britannica incorporated the Personal Brain to cope with this predicament. But an informal poll I conducted online shows that few know how to deploy it effectively.The Britannica also sports Student and Elementary versions of its venerable flagship product, replete with a Homework Helpdesk, how to documents, and interactive games, activities, and math and science tutorials. Still, the Britannica is far better geared to tackle the information needs of adults and, even more so, professionals. It provides unequalled coverage of its topics.Ironically, this is precisely why the market positioning of the Britannicas Elementary and Student Encyclopedias is problematic: compared to the Wikipedia, the Britannicas brand is distinctly adult and scholarly. The vacuum left by the Encarta (lamented) discontinuance, though, should make it easier to market the Student and Elementary versions (which are an integral part of the Ultimate Edition and not sold separately).Still, the 2011 editions of both the Student and Elementary encyclopedias improve on the past in terms of both coverage and facilities: the Homework Helpdesk is a collection of useful homework resources including a video subject browse; online learning games and activities; online subject spotlights; and how-to documents on topics such as writing a book review. There are also Learning Games and Activities: hundreds of fun and interactive games and activities to help students with subjects like Math, Science, and Social Studies. Both versions are updated monthly with new online-only articles.The current edition is fully integrated with the Internet. Apart from articles about new topics and personalities in the news, it offers additional and timely content and revisions on a dedicated Web site. The digital product includes a staggering number of links (165,808!) to third party content and articles on the Web. The GeoAnalyzer, which compares national statistical data and generates charts and graphs, is now Web-based and greatly enhanced.The Britannica would do well to offer a browser add-on search bar and to integrate with desktop search tools from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and others. Currently it offers search results through Google but this requires the user to install add-ons or plug-ins and to go through a convoluted rite of passage. A seamless experience is in the cards. Users must and will be able to ferret content from all over - their desktop, their encyclopedias, and the Web - using a single, intuitive interface.Some minor gripes:The atlas, dictionary, and thesaurus incorporated in the Britannica are still surprisingly outdated. Why not use a more current - and dynamically updated - offering? What about dictionaries for specialty terms (medical or computer glossaries, for instance)?Despite considerable improvement over the previous edition, the Britannica still consumes (not to say hogs) computer resource far in excess of the official specifications. This makes it less suitable for installation on older PCs and on netbooks. If you own a machine with anything earlier than Pentium 4, less than 1 Gb RAM, and less than 10 Gb of really free space, the Britannica would be clunky at best.But thats it. Dont think twice. Run to the closest retail outlet (or surf to the Britannicas Web site) and purchase the 2010 edition now. It offers excellent value for money (less than $40, with a rebate). For less than the price of an antivirus software and for a fraction of the cost of Windows 7, you will significantly enhance your access to the sum total of human knowledge and wisdom.With the demise of Microsofts Encarta (it has been discontinued) and the tribulations of the Wikipedia (its rules have been revamped to resemble a traditional encyclopedia, alienating its contributors in the process), the Encyclopedia Britannica 2010 (established in 1768) may have won the battle of reference.

Its even worse when the environment is 3D! Plus, you have to keep on switching between 2 disks! Its very tiring and annoying. If you have a fast computer, the likeliness of it is that itll freeze a lot. Thats what happened on my computer and its fast, but when my friend played it (who has a slow computer), it only froze ONCE. But on the plus side, the whole concept of taking Nancy Drew books and turning them into interactive mystery games for children is brilliant.

This one, Secrets Can Kill, was my least favorite.  In all fairness, this was the first Nancy Drew game they made, and its understandable that the graphics arent as good as in the later two.  This also may explain why the game is shorter; Im guessing they realized that the game would be better if it took longer, so the other two games (Stay Tuned For Danger and Message In a Haunted Mansion) have more playing time.  On the other hand, because it is shorter, its also easier, so this might be better for slightly younger girls than the other two.  Also, this game requires 2 CDs--you have to switch back and forth.  This was annoying at first, but soon became bearable.  But really, this game was a lot of fun.  Even with the less-than-stellar graphics, there were still a lot of word puzzles and things to explore.  This game and Message both have slide puzzles, though, which I cant stand.

While Stay Tuned for Danger still leaves quite a lot to be desired, it definitely shows improvement in the overall quality of the Nancy Drew games. This is a step in the right direction.This game takes place shortly after Secrets Can Kill. Famous soap opera star of Light of Our Love fame, Mattie Jensen, has caught ear of how Nancy solved her last case. Mattie calls Nancys Aunt Eloise (whos coincidentally a friend of hers) to request that Nancy fly up to her apartment in New York City to solve a brand new case. Matties co-star, Rick Arlen, has been receiving death threats. Nobody knows who theyre coming from, and despite the treats becoming more serious, Rick refuses to go to the police. Its now up to Nancy to go undercover as an extra on the set to find a would-be killer...The plot is solid, and despite the age of this game, it remains one of the greatest plots Ive ever seen in a Nancy Drew game. It has a very mature, dark, and frightening atmosphere. Even though this game doesnt deal with curses or ghostly haunts, the threats that Rick (and later, Nancy) receives from the culprit become very life-threatening and haunting in and of themselves.The quality of the game leaves a lot to be desired, but its a big step up from Secrets Can Kill. Thankfully there is no longer any need to switch between discs. The controls still lack user friendliness, but they have improved slightly (now there is no longer need to scroll up and down through the environment as well as left to right). There are also more puzzles, some of them holding on to the quality level that the modern games have.Sadly, its very easy to run into glitches and have to start the game over. Its easy to miss important items that Nancy must pick up to solve the case, and therefore requires the player to start the game over again or wait a long period of time doing nothing until finally being able to get where Nancy needs to be to pick up the item. This is my biggest complaint about the game, as this makes it very frustrating for the player if he/she runs into these setbacks.The graphics are still weak, but theyve improved significantly. The characters are now 3D like the environments. They look more like Barbie dolls than actual people, but its much better than having them look like 2D cartoons. The environmental graphics are of mostly the same quality as the first game, but that isnt a very bad thing (especially considering the age of this game).The characters in this game probably rank among the best casts in a Nancy Drew game yet. There are SO many characters in the game (six suspects, with eleven characters playing a part of the story). The suspects include Mattie Jensen, who might be using Nancy to throw suspicion off of herself, Rick Arlen, who might be behind the threats to gain publicity, Dwayne Powers, Matties agent (formerly Ricks too) who is jealous of Ricks success, Millie Strathorn, the eccentric old lady who owns the WWB Network (the studio where Light of Our Love is recorded) and has a hard time differentiating truth from reality, Bill Pappas, the unseen producer of the show, and Lillian Weiss, the angry and bitter director of Light of Our Love. There are also two characters who play roles in the story, but arent interactive suspects. These include Ralph Guardino, who is the security guard of WWB but can never really be questioned as a suspect, and Owen Spayder, an unseen stagehand who seems to have a larger role in the story later on. Nancys best friends Bess Marvin and George Fayne and her boyfriend Ned Nickerson can still be called for help like in the first game, but theyre also able to be conversed with about her case and even provide insight into the case itself.The music in the game is also well done. I prefer the Secrets Can Kill soundtrack, but the soundtrack heard in this game is also very enjoyable. It held on to the perfect New York City feel while leaving off an atmosphere of mystery. The music heard while sneaking into the studio at night made the place all the more eerie, while the music heard while exploring Matties apartment during the day was rather upbeat. Id say that the soundtrack was perfect.While Stay Tuned for Danger remains a bit of a sub-par game, its a drastic improvement compared to its predecessor. If youve played this and are considering giving up of the Nancy Drew games, please dont do so yet. Starting with Message in a Haunted Mansion, the Nancy Drew games really do get better from here on out, and Stay Tuned for Danger does tell an awesome story thats worth experiencing. Im hoping that a re-release of this game is issued (like the one they did with Secrets Can Kill, but staying more true to the original this time), because it could use some improvements and the original isnt compatible with computers more advanced than Windows XP. Those who started playing the Nancy Drew games later on deserve to experience the first two games, and the first two games also deserve better quality. So, heres to hoping for Stay Tuned for Danger Remastered!", "unixReviewTime": "1306281600"}

After I tried it again and managed to finish it, this game quickly became one of my favorite Nancy Drew games. Stay Tuned for Danger may be one of the older games in the Nancy Drew adventure game series, but it is also one of the best.Story-A soap opera star has called you to New York to figure out who is sending death threats to her co star. It soon becomes evident that someone is out to hurt or kill him as the threats elevate and some near fatal accidents occur. It is up to you to figure out who is causing it all.Graphics-Although the graphics are much better than the first game, they still arent perfect. They are in 3D, and the 3D is done pretty well. The characters are also pretty good, but they tend to freeze in awkward positions as they are done talking, only resuming movement when they start to talk again. But, overall, the graphics are pretty good.Sound-The music in the game is OK, but it really doesnt stand out as being catchy. The background sounds are good in the game, and the voice acting is good, too. Some of the voice actors sound like they were really into their parts while some sounded like they were bored.Gameplay-This game, like all games in the Nancy Drew adventure series, is a first-person point-and-click game. You will move around between 3 main locations while solving puzzles, questioning suspects, and finding clues. The puzzles in this game are very innovative and may require some serious thought to solve them, but although they are a challenge, they are still really fun. In addition to talking to about 6 people in the game, you can also call your friends on the phone to talk over the case from them. You can also ask them for help which is a way to get hints for what to do next.Length-Its a pretty good-sized game. Theres a lot to do throughout the game, and its not necessarily very obvious what to do next. The game should probably last several hours at least.All in all, this is probably one of the most challenging and fun games in the Nancy Drew series. It lasts a while, and it incorporates great adventure gaming elements into the gameplay.

Windows 98 was easy on the memory-hogging a/v pizazz, but where Windows 98 ultimately fails is in the security department. I expect my OS to be secure. In addition, I expect my OS to be stable. Windows 98 frequently crashes...sometimes for what seems like no reason at all! Windows 98 fails these tests.2. Windows XP. Windows XP is based on the stable Windows NT architecture, but XP fails with me on several issues. The first issue is too much a/v pizazz in the GUI. I want an OS with a GUI that just works without any frilly stuff. Number two, Windows XP has been very suspectible to security flaws since its release. And number three, Windows XP is not as stable as Windows 2000 Professional and crashes from time to time. So Windows XP fails these tests.3. Linux. I mainly use Xandros and Linspire as my choices of Linux distributions. Linux was built to be secure and stable. Xandros and Linspire are both secure and stable, but sometimes their GUIs (the KDE desktop environment) seem memory-hogging. Ubuntu Linux has a GUI called GNOME which isnt as memory-hogging, but GNOME just doesnt feel the same as Windows. I dont consider any of these Linux distributions to fail my test because I use Linux more than any other OS, including Windows 2000 Professional.4. Windows 2000 Professional. Windows 2000 Professional offers me many security options...even though a good firewall and antivirus tool helps out more, Windows 2000 Professional was BUILT to be secure and stable. Windows 98 crashed like a mofo, and Windows XP likes to crash from time to time. I have yet to have Windows 2000 Professional to crash on me. In addition, Windows 2000 Professional gives me a GUI which doesnt rely on frilly nonsense...the a/v pizazz I mentioned above.Windows 2000 Professional is an OS that is stable, secure, and just works.

A lot of Microsoft staff was there. One quick note is that there were two types of staff. One wore red shirts, and the others wore blue shirts. The whole day seminar/presentation started with an explanation of, If you have a technical question, ask one of the Microsoft staff in a red shirt, if you have a sales or marketing question, ask a blue shirt. I got a charge out of that. Sales people are enamored with what the software can do for you, and the technical staff is enamored in how it can do it.What I really wanted to share with you is the major difference between W2000 and 98; In W2000 the system files are off bounds by different programs regarding, not being able to modify them for each program. In 98, that doesnt hold true. If a change needs to be made to a system file, then the outside software manufacturer can do it. The only help is that you can run system file checker in 98 to check for modified system files, and correct them.What W2000 does is amazing. Not only can an outside manufacturer not be able to change system files, if you go in and delete a system file, then exit out of the folder, then go back in, sure enough the system file you just deleted was automatically restored when you exited out of the folder.Another point I wanted to make; the overwhelming advantage of using W2000 over XP when installing in an older machine is that it is compatible with a lot of the older hardware.  Here is the problem: You install XP, and up comes a warning that your hardware is not compatible, or needs drivers loaded in order to work. The manufacturers on the other hand, made your older component, whether it is a sound card, or video card, long before XP arrived, so they never created software drivers for it to run in XP. Nor do they want to spend the resources, to create drivers for a product that they stopped manufacturing 6 years ago. You have to check with the individual components to see if drivers are available for XP before buying it, or replace components. The advantage with W2000 is that you are getting the reliability, and the older hardware (within reason) compatibility. XP is built on the Windows 2000 platform.I just built a new machine, so I installed XP Pro on it, and I also picked up a copy of W2000 from an independent seller here at Amazon, and loaded it on my AMD K62-500 for the network. Although I did have one video card that didnt have a W2000 driver, so I changed that very inexpensively with a great 128meg video card on sale with rebates for $29. So my old machines that were built in 1999 run W2000 great. No more programs freeze when several programs are open at the same time. You can leave a machine sitting for a couple of hours and not have it respond poorly when you come back to it, and have to reboot. No more blue screen error reports, having to reboot and run scan disk.On my new XP machine, I had a bad program loaded, and when would run it, I would get a millisecond error screen, with an instant shut down, then it would reboot without having to run scan disk. I am assuming that since you cant mess with system files, no errors are created. I removed the program, which was a Mickey mouse add on included with a hardware bundle.Windows 2000 pro rocks.

In this game, Nancy is staying with a soap star, Mattie, whose on-screen co-star, Rick, has been receiving death threats.  Its up to Nancy to find out who is behind them.  The game requires not only patience but a smart mind; you have to remember things and write down clues, solve puzzles, and plan things accordingly.  Although I enjoyed playing it, it was frustrating at times, and one time, I spent several hours thinking I was stuck, because I had not noticed the arrival of an important new object. (Boy did I feel silly when I finally noticed it!)  This game will take you many hours to complete.  For fans of the older Nancy Drew books, theres an added bonus -- the games feature objects from the books (look for the clock from The Secret of the Old Clock, with the crescent on the top!) and other little fun things like that.  I want to offer two hints that I think will be helpful: #1, pay attention to the chair in Matties house, near the phone.  #2, explore all rooms **thoroughly**.  You will pick up many objects during this game, and all will either be important, or finding them will just advance the game.  You may need to explore rooms two or three times to find everything.  Also, if after youve installed this game (or Message In A Haunted Mansion), you get an error message that the game can not locate a Direct Draw Surface, and you KNOW your computer meets all the system requirements, make sure your hardware acceleration is set to FULL.  If youre using Windows 98 you can do this by going to your Control Panel, clicking on Display, then clicking on the Settings tab, then clicking the Advanced... button, then clicking the Performance tab, and pushing the bar all the way up to Full.  Then youll need to restart you computer.  This solved the problem for me.  Hope this helps!

For those of you who are not  familiar with Dramatica, it is a creative writing tool which helps you  decide where your story is going by asking you certain questions about  plot, themes, character motivation, and story dynamics. It offers you two  ways to do this: the short version (50 questions), which only takes you a  day, or the long version (200+ questions), which could take you up to a  week.

And while I find Dramatica has some good points, I find that there are some parts of this application that are just clunky. Number 1. The character creation screens and data is just terrible. For an application of this price I would expect a little more thorough approach. I would rally like an opportunity to compile a characters background, history and personal info within the application. Id also like to be able to flag some of these traits so that they can be added to the story or become part of subplots used in the story. For instance if a character is insecure, Id like to add that as an emotional goal to overcome during the length of the story. Id also like to export characters easily for use in subsequent stories. This is not easily done.  In my opinion, the entire Character generation screen is useless. (I wont even go there about the UGLY selection of character portraits). Come on, for this price get some nice looking professional icons rather than those ugly clip-art ones, OR make it easier to ad your own portraits.. Have you tried importing a portrait? Its not easy let me tell you!  When trying to chose an icon to represent my protagonist I had a choice between X-Men and small cheap looking pictures of ugly cartoons. Come on now.On to the software, I like the storyforming tools. But really the terminology at points is obscure. When it says my main characters thematic opposite to the area of Johns greatest sensitivity concerns willingness to reevaluate it would be nice if I didnt have to refer to the manual to figure out what that means.  Im not a dummy, but I would like to be able to use the software without having to refer to the HELP.Overall, I LIKE Dramatica Pro. But its by no means an easy App to work with.

This is the hard part to Dramatica, since  ideal prior art probably doesnt exist, from which to refer,  except for the possibility of future works skilfully created with Dramatica.Now theres a chicken or the egg paradox.", "unixReviewTime": "1067385600"}

As a video game fan growing up in the 80s, I noticed that there were very few girl-oriented games out there.  There were plenty for boys; and a few for both sexes, like Tetris and Wheel of Fortune, and, of course, the ever-popular Mario Bros. series.  But even the Mario games favored boys.  There were always more male characters to choose from than females (thered be, maybe one girl, the Princess, who sported a pink dress.) And the games JUST for girls would be, like, Ataris Strawberry Shortcake game, where youd get to switch around everybodys outfits.  Now, in the year 2001, theres plenty of girl software out there, but Im not interested in PC Diaries, where girls can record their innermost secrets and keep them locked up with a voice-activated password.  Ive outgrown being interested in designing clothes for Barbie.  (They need a game where you can design a Barbie house!  Now that would be cool.)  Not that theres anything wrong with those games; its just that theyre very tame, and some girls, like myself, want adventure.  Believe it or not, the box for this Nancy Drew game sports the phrase For adventurous girls, ages 10 and up.  Thats me! (A bit over 10, but whos counting?)  But enough with the introductions -- let me describe the game.  Its an adventure game; Choose Your Own Adventure-esque.  Nancy is staying in a mansion thats someday going to be a Bed & Breakfast.  Theres a problem though -- a bunch of accidents have been happening.  Your job, as Nancy, is to find clues, solve puzzles, talk to people, and solve the mystery of whos responsible for the accidents.  But you soon discover that you have a SECOND mystery to deal with.  This game requires logic, patience, and a curious mind.  What amazed me was how long the game took to complete; theres really a lot to do.  But after about 14-16 hours of game play, I have finished the game, and Im sad.  So -- I think Ill order the other two Nancy Drew games that are on amazon! ;)  Please, DreamCatcher games and Her Interactive -- keep these coming!  I want more Nancy Drew games.

{"overall": 4.0, "reviewerID": "A13BTMCSLTQ48R", "asin": "B000050HEI", "reviewText": "This is an old Nancy Drew game. But Ive learned not to pre-judge the older games; its the plot and puzzles that drive these games, not the graphics. That said, this game was not mind-blowing. If you want to go for a classic Nancy Drew title, I would suggest the game that came after this, Treasure in the Royal Tower (#4). Im going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.PLOT - 4/5: Nancy is off to San Francisco to help a friend of Hannahs renovate a Victorian mansion. This friend, Rose Green, spent her life savings on the historic home and plans to turn it into a Bed & Breakfast. But strange accidents have been setting back the renovations and if things keep going badly Rose will have to sell the house and lose her investment.I thought this was an alright plot,  it was very short though. On the back of the CD case it said 20+ hours of gameplay, but I finished mine in about 4 hours. Other than that, there were lots of snooping opportunities - in fact, Nancy gets to snoop through all four of the suspects things. The plot flowed nicely and there was enough progression in the story that I never felt stuck in the same place for too long. But it wasnt as educational as other games have been. I love San Francisco and it would have been great if they had included more information about its Victorian houses, its role in the Gold Rush, how it recovered from the earthquake of 1906, or how its Chinese history influences its style and culture - really, any of those things would have been great because it gave you little tid-bits about each of them but not nearly enough information to be considered educational. Which is a shame really because the plot and setting gave the game the perfect set up; it could have seamlessly put in so much information without having the player feel like Oh great, here comes another history lesson.CHARACTERS - 3.5/5: The suspect list in this game is pretty straightforward. There are two male suspects and two female suspects (a formula which I believe is pretty common to the earlier ND titles). The suspects include Rose Green, the owner of the mansion, a quiet woman who didnt have too much to say throughout the game. Abby Sideris, a friend of Roses and is also co-owner of the mansion, who believes the mansion is haunted. Charlie Murphy, a college student and inexperienced handyman helping with renovating the mansion (Charlie was voiced by Scott Carty, who does Neds voice in the later games). Louis Chandler is an antique dealer specializing in Victorian era furniture and decorations.The graphics were... interesting - but I wasnt expecting a whole lot considering its an older game. Louis was probably the strangest to talk to because it would seem that sometimes his eyes would be closed for an entire conversation, which may or may not have been a glitch in my game. The characters were not too memorable. Rose and Louis were particularly boring. I dont know if the voice acting on these characters was just bland or if their characters were meant to be more reserved.Phone friends included Bess and George, a woman named Emily who is apparently a friend of Nancys in San Francisco, and Hannah. In the books Hannah is the Drews live-in house keeper who is practically a surrogate mother to Nancy, and the games also allude to the fact that Hannah is an important part of the Drew family. This was the first time Ive been able to talk to Hannah in a Nancy Drew game. But Hannahs voice was really odd, like a young person that was obviously trying to sound like an old woman, so I didnt call her very much.SETTING - 4.5/5: The mansion was very lovely and nicely decorated. It was pretty big too; Nancy can explore her room, the dining room, the basement saloon, the foyer, the parlor, and the library as well as a handful of secret rooms. I sort of wished you could go outside, or look out a window or something, but I guess the weather was supposed to be bad and that was the reason for staying indoors.PUZZLES - 4.5/5: The puzzles were not too challenging in this game. I suppose that if you struggled with them then you might spend 20+ hours playing the game like the CD case promised. But I have played enough Nancy Drew games to recognize a clue when I see one and got through the puzzles pretty easily. My only complaint would be that at times the instructions were kind of vague, for instance at one point a character asked Nancy to take a look at a puzzle in the corner. I spent over a half an hour looking for that corner before eventually looking it up online and discovering that the puzzle was directly behind the character.IS IT CHALLENGING? No. Im starting to wonder if maybe Im getting better at these games or if I just happen to be playing the easiest titles in the series. Either way, I didnt have to use a walkthrough. I did call Bess and George a lot, though. And they were very explicit with their hints. It wasnt like Maybe you should take a look at the library again! it was more Go into the library, turn left, and read the red book on the middle shelf. Which was sort of a bummer; I just wanted a push in the right direction, I didnt want to know exactly how to solve the next puzzle and what would happen when I did. I would give the game a 2.5/5 for challenge.ENDING - 3.5/5: The ending was okay. The culprit was not surprising to me. Catching them took me a few tries even though I knew exactly what to do. But it was still a solid ending and the wrap up in the epilogue at the end was nice.FINAL SCORE:Plot: 4Characters: 3.5Setting: 4.5Puzzles: 4.5Challenge: 2.5Ending: 3.5= 22.5 divided by 6 = 3.75 rounded to 4 stars", "unixReviewTime": "1370908800"}

This game sets the standard to what the majority of Nancy Drew games contain, and is the first to use the formal Nancy Drew case formula. It is this game that employs several aspects that become rules for future cases, such as there must always be four suspects and there must always be a long-lost treasure.Rose Green, a friend of Hannah Gruens (Nancys housekeeper), has recently purchased a Victorian mansion in San Francisco, California. She and her friend and co-owner, Abby Sideris, hope to turn the place into a bed-and-breakfast by the following month. However, several peculiar accidents have been getting in the way of the renovations. Hannah asks that Nancy go over to help complete the renovation, while secretly performing an investigation to find out just whats causing the accidents. Nancy soon finds herself in an old mansion thats filled with a dark past, unexplainable shadows, ghostly voices, and unexpected accidents that could happen at any moment. Is an inhabitant of this manor trying to scare everybody away, or are the restless spirits of the previous owners truly back to haunt the place?The plot used in this game is phenomenal, and a great idea for Nancys first haunted house mystery. Even though the criminal in this game isnt a killer, it still holds on to the scare factor that the first two held, and the danger does become life-threatening at times. The game itself does get pretty scary, and all of the references to the history of California and China that were employed in the plot were very well-integrated.I will come out and say this about the plot: the ending does become very predictable if one pays attention closely. The location of the ending, the history of the Valdez family (the family who originally owned the manor), the culprit, and his/her intentions all become rather obvious. This is a slight downside, but regardless, all of these aspects of the plot were perfectly executed.Even though this is only the third game, the quality of this game rivals (and usually even goes beyond) most of the modern games. There are still chores that need to be done and puzzles to solve, but Nancy doesnt spend more time doing chores than investigating or performing puzzle after puzzle after puzzle like she does in several of the more recent games. This game has the perfect blend of sleuthing, puzzle-solving, and chores.The graphics in this game might show the age on occasion, but theyre still rather nice, and almost as good as graphics in a modern game would be. The manor is beautifully detailed, and all of the ghostly haunts that are seen with the eye are wonderfully animated. The character designs are a little more smooth and realistic than the ones in the previous game, now looking like a cross between Barbie dolls and actual human anatomy.The characters were casted wonderfully, and they were all well-integrated into the story. Rose Green, the owner, is the frustrated woman who spent her entire life savings into the house. Shes very determined to stick with the place, but is starting to get discouraged. Abby Sideris is her eccentric business partner, who believes in ghosts and all sorts of supernatural phenomenon. At one point in the game, she even hosts a sance to contact the spirit haunting the house. Charlie Murphy is a young man whos currently employed to help with the renovations. He seems young and inexperienced, but is actually very knowledgeable and is studying history at the local community college. Louis Chandler is an antique dealer about Roses age, and hes helping the others find some good authentic dcor to keep the traditional Victorian feel while renovating the manor into a B&B.One wonderful aspect about the cast in Message in a Haunted Mansion that definitely deserves mention is the perfect choice for the culprit. Its not quite like the previous game, Stay Tuned for Danger, in which Mattie, Rick, Dwayne, Lillian, Bill, and Millie all have solid motives to send the threats to Rick and could very well be the culprit at the end. Theres only one character in this game that would seem to profit well from performing these acts of vandalism around the house, and I cannot see any of the other suspects being the culprit in the end.The music in the game was perfect. It made an already very frightening house seem even more haunted. There wasnt a single track that felt out of place, and they ranged from slightly eerie to downright terrifying. The Chinese music heard in Nancys bedroom complimented the dcor as well, as her room is full of old Chinese furnishings.Message in a Haunted Mansion has brought the Nancy Drew games from sub-par, old school fun to true accomplishments in the history of adventure gaming. From this point forward, the Nancy Drew games have a tendency to be amazing. Despite the age, this beautiful game full of ghostly frights remains in my top ten favorite Nancy Drew games of all time.", "unixReviewTime": "1306368000"}

In Message in a Haunted Mansion they definitely did that while still making it a fun adventure game that wasnt horrifying.Story-You are going to help a family friend find out why there are so many accidents happening at the house that shes renovating.  Some people claim that a ghost is at work, while others think that something human is the cause.  Its up to you to find out who or what is sabotaging the renovation work.Graphics-Like the previous games, the graphics are 3D, and once again, they are pretty good.  Some of the characters have some awkward movements, but the backgrounds are very well done.Sound-The music is spooky and definitely creates a good atmosphere.  There are also some creepy background sounds that happen from time-to-time to startle the player a bit.  As for the voice acting, the characters could have been voiced much better.  They often sound bored or confused as to what they are reading, but they are still good enough to not distract from the gameplay.Gameplay-Just like the previous games in the series, this is a first person point-and-click adventure game.  It only takes place in one location (a mansion), but you are still able to explore many rooms as you search for clues as to who or what is causing the accidents.  There are four suspects to talk to in this game, and there are also several people that you can call on the phone to ask for help in your investigation.  There are a few puzzles in the game that are more like chores than puzzles, but they are a good variety of inventory puzzles and logic puzzles.  There are a few scary moments in the game where you see a shadow move or something in order to startle you, but they would happen over and over again at the same place that by the end of the game, you are just bored by them.  It does add a certain scare factor to the game the first time you see them, though.  There are also some bonus backstories for two of the characters that you dont necessarily have to discover to finish the game, but it was fun to figure out, and it adds a bit to the plot.Length-Its a fairly long game.  It will definitely take several hours to finish.Overall, it can be a slightly creepy game if you let it get to you.  But whether you get spooked or not, it truly is a fascinating mystery adventure game that is worth a playthrough.SPECIAL NOTE-There is also a version of this game available for the Game Boy Advance.", "unixReviewTime": "1260576000"}

Is the house really haunted?The only problem I encountered was that I must have played out of order, because I kept finding clues and I had no idea what they were related to. The story seemed disjointed and not as in-depth as with Treasure in the Royal Tower. But I really enjoyed the bandit/Chinese subplot, the sance, and the many puzzles. The sound effects were genuinely creepy: one minute you will be walking down the hallway and the sound of a woman crying comes from nowhere. Or youre walking up a deserted staircase and you hear ghostly whispers.There are two levels, junior and senior detective. The puzzles are slightly harder for senior detectives, but the plot is the same. If you get stuck you can call your friends Bess and George for hints. I needed to look online for hints quite a bit since, as I said earlier, I must have missed clues since large parts of the story were missing for me.One of the things that bugged me was the fact that there really werent many places to explore. You cant leave the house, and you only have access to your room and one other room, the attic, the dining room, parlor, and basement. I was hoping for more rooms/secret passageways to explore. Not having more locations really cut down on the games length/replayability.Overall, Message in a Haunted Mansion is a fun outing for detectives: a chance to explore a spooky haunted house, gather clues, learn about Chinese art and writing, and dig up clues about a timeless love story and hidden treasure.", "unixReviewTime": "1049587200"}

The unique office-friendly design with integrated mounting and cable management are stand-out differentiators. This smart-switch has management capability appropriate for a office environment switch with power-saving electronics.Design:One of the first things that stands out on the ProSAFE Click switches is the form factor. The sleek dimensions clearly have the modular office environment in mind and can mount at many places in modular non-modular office environments.The click mounting system makes mounting a snap - literally. The locking tab make secure mounting of the Click Switch to the base in any of 2 orientations.The 8 port version has a sturdy plastic case in a silent fanless design. The 16 port model is also fanless, but has a durable metal case.The 8 port model provides 2 convenient USB charging ports suitable for tablets and other high-charge USB applications.  The power budget is 15W for both and any one port limited to 10W. This makes it handy in offices and conference rooms making it convenient for tablets or phones to get a charge boost. I like this in my home office because it eliminates 2 power bricks from my power strip.The interesting power connection can be plugged in to have the cable exit either in the same direction and the network cables or at 90 degrees to that out the long dimension. There is no power brick to clog up power strips - the power adapter is internal to the switch. Something I find a very desirable feature.The included Velcro cables tie completes the picture of switch design by someone who was thinking about usability in the real world as much as moving bits and bytes.Configuration:I downloaded and installed the ProSafe Plus Configuration Utility from the Netgear support site. The configuration utility found the switch automagically making it super easy perform initial setup on the Click Switch. The intuitive process was easy and there are only a couple of things to setup unless you need advanced features. Set the IP address - I recommend setting either a static IP address or a DHCP reserved address (what I did in my firewall) so the switch will always be at the same IP address. Change the password - The default password is password, so change it to something better!The Click Switch also has a web based management interface that is very usable if you prefer that instead of the configuration utility. I do.The advanced (and just nice) configurable features include: The port LEDs can be turned off so they are not distracting (Just nice and good for bedrooms too!) IEEE 802.1Q-or port-based VLANs are supported for segregated traffic (i.e. voip/data) Extensive QoS by WRR, strict priority, or both, Port-based QoS, IEEE 801.2p QoS, ToS QoS and DSCP based QoS. These are to help make sure time sensitive traffic gets priority (i.e. voip or video). Port by port Rate limiting Port by port link speed and flow control settings (including a disable setting to turn a port off if desired) Port by port Broadcast Filtering Port by port cable testing (good for a quick cable integrity check) Multicast control via IGMP snooping Port mirroring which connects two ports like a old school hub (good for troubleshooting or some monitoring)Note: the 8 port model has no LAG (Link Aggregation Groups aka Trunking). The 16 port model has up to 2 LAG group which can be nice for devices with 2 LAN ports that support static LAG. NAS devices come to mind.Most users will not need to mess with most of the advanced features.Green Power Use:The 8 port Click Switch uses a max of 20.1W of power including 15W of USB charging occurring at the same time. This means without someone charging their device power maxes out about 5W. With smart port power management most of the time power consumption should be less. Perhaps much less. This is less power than used to be common for unmanaged or dumb switches. The savings can add up if you have a bunch of these in your business.Support:I did not need to contact support with the 8 port Click switch, but while testing my 16 port model I did and got excellent support. Be sure to register your Click switch within 30 days of purchase and youll get  a lifetime warranty for a little extra peace of mind.Conclusions:The Netgear ProSAFE 8-Port Gigabit Click Switch has game-changing office oriented design and usability in a silent package. It is a capable smart switch which has good management and important features. The advanced features can make it possible to reliably integrate time sensitive traffic in the same switch as NAS file sharing, isolate traffic via VLAN support and more.The switch is wire-speed which means it can move traffic as fast as it can be pushed over the individual LAN cables. In my testing this is the case as with pretty much any modern smart and many dumb switches. Getting data through a switch has become pretty much a given these days.I had moved away from Netgear switches in recent years. Other manufacturers had more attractive solutions for my clients needs. Not so with the Click Switch. Because Netgear has built a compelling product for office (and many other) environments with a fairly rich feature set and easily managed Im giving it 5 stars.Ill be placing these into my client environments as new switches are needed. Well done Netgear.Hope this helps someone!", "unixReviewTime": "1429574400"}

{"overall": 5.0, "reviewerID": "A2UL0DVTM8KVNV", "asin": "B000050ZRE", "reviewText": "OverviewThis is a great array for someone looking to expand their home storage network or possibly someone with a SOHO setup that needs plenty of storage. I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.UnpackingThe array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.InstallationYou will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.HardwareAll hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.The array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.One HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.SoftwareThe CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90s, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.I did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.A nice feature is that the HDs SMART monitoring information is available via the arrays driver software.FeaturesThe amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.During my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.The BadThe only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.ConclusionThis is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00. It certainly is not enterprise class, but then again, neither is the price.", "unixReviewTime": "1332720000"}

I had five bars almost the entire way to the end of the dock.  When I reached the furthest point from the antenna, I had one bar of signal.

I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I cant test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.  So the only gripe I have with small devices like this is that they are too light.  They are at the mercy of the weight of the cables plugged into them.

For instance, I have a PRISMIQ Media Player that hooks to the TV to watch videos and photos stored on the computer.That device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).I wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didnt want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.A bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the devices RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, its talking to a wired ethernet, even while its not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.Setup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devicess IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and thats it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesnt have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).Another bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, dont worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebooks ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and thats it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.The downside: Its expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive ethernet to Wi-Fi converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.The PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang g) and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps turbo mode in 802.11a! (havent tested it).", "unixReviewTime": "1099440000"}

I had a horrible time installing it and it never really worked right.  When I purchased a Western Digital USB 2.0 External Hard Drive to add to my system is when I found out not all usb cards are created the same. The WD hard drive just would not operate on the cheaper usb 2.0 card. I could not transfer files or write to the drive without getting errors.  I thought it was the hard drive but after exchanging it and getting another one only to have the same problem I determined it must be the usb controller.That is when I searched the net and looked at reviews for the best USB 2.0 card out right now.  Every computer magazine website gave this card excellent reviews so I thought I would buy it from Amazon.com and give it a try.It was very easy to install and I absolutely love the added front USB port which is included in the box and fits in an open 5 1/4 bay.  Since I have an older machine I did not have any front usb ports. With this in mind along with the great reviews it has been given the purchase was a no brainer.

I use it for everything, rarely using Word, Office and so forth.  My two major tools for editing and writing are Front Page and super Notepad instead.

Besides, I can now read and write html so I am not as utterly dependent on Front Page as I once was.  If you dont know any html coding, the basis of all web pages, Front Page is the program for you.  I also do all my image editing in Photoshop so dont even need that function in Front Page.  Dreamweaver is the industry standard instead of Front Page yet Front Page is the ordinary users program of choice.  The reason for this is that you can know very little about computers and still make a website with Front Page.  It even made publishing websites idiot proof by using Front Page Server extensions with many web host providers.  Thus, one can totally skip learning ftp protocol by using Front Page server extensions instead.  If someone wants to go professionally into web page design, this is not the product, Dreamweaver is.  People who already are professionals in the computer industry or in web design tell me they dont like Front Page.  I think the reason is that since they dont need (or want) Front Page to do their work for them, they desire a program which gives them a much freer hand.

This time, Nancy Drew is snowed in at a modern-day castle in Wisconsin. Shell meet some strange people, sneak through creepy secret passages, and find beautiful trinkets and treasures ... not without the usual dangers, of course... Nancy Drew cant really avoid those.  There will always be an evil villain trying to do her in.  But hey, its all in good fun.  If youve played the other Nancy Drew games, this is more of the same.  Most similar to Message In A Haunted Mansion (in my opinion), this game offers puzzles that are similar to puzzles in the first 3 games, but with one or two totally original ones.  Other than a few surprises, theres nothing in here thats really superior to the other games; Id say they are all pretty equal.  Still, another Nancy Drew adventure is a good time waiting to happen.  It took me about 12 hours to complete on the junior level, though the box claims it can take you 20.  So... take your time, take the 20, and have fun, this game is great.

{"overall": 4.0, "reviewerID": "A1DER9ALIMLFBK", "asin": "B00005LVWL", "reviewText": "This is my 21st review and completed adventure in the Nancy Drew series.First, Id like to start by dividing my review into two factions.1) The game itself2) My personal detective work.* PART 1 *PLOT: A fierce blizzard at a Wisconsin ski resort has Nancy Drew holed-up with a handful of vacationers. She is on the trail of a missing journal of Marie Antoinettes that would lead to a sacred treasure hidden by the ill-fated queen back in the 18th century. Her sanctuary was the Chteau Rochemont in France relocated & rebuilt by a chocolate milk tycoon in America.  I found it generally interesting to be able to explore the monstrosity that was the castle, but later became irritated by the tasks that had me zipping all over the place with a clunky interface.INITIAL SCORE: 88CHARACTERS:Dexter Egan: This was one of the more interesting characters that HER has ever produced as it showed the light and dark side of a man growing up as an adopted child by the millionaire, Ezra Wickford. Ezra had such affection for the boy Dexter [spelling bee champion, volunteer work during WW2 era]  until he felt he could no longer trust him with his future estate based on criminal fraud convictions. Great plot line and I loved the two journals in the secret study!Jacques Brunais: He was sappy right from the start! I was very surprised that HER had the character end relations with Nancy on such a horrible note, but I actually LIKED that story derivative!  It showed the live emotions of irrational people [like in real life].Lisa Ostrum: Usually when a shady past is shoved in your face early in the storyline, that is a sign that this isnt the culprit.  I had Lisa pegged as my # 1 suspect only because the other characters were pressed into showing their flaws throughout the adventure too thoroughly and I had reasons to think they HAD problems, but they werent directly related to the vandalism. Tara V. Smith [who voiced Lisa] did a fine job, but it sounded rather cartoonish also [like a Peanuts character] and I found it hard to take this photojournalist seriously.Professor Beatrice Hotchkiss: God, this woman was something else. I loved the HER comedy bit with the fifty chicken legs and probably would never had done most of  the chores she asked out of shock she would ever impose this on me.  I doubt I would have been so forthcoming with her as the ND did, because she was just as much a suspect as anyone else there.Ned/Bess/George: The voice actors [Claire Gallagher & Maureen Nelson] sounded like they were reading scripts because half of the dialogue didnt flow naturally, but the written dialogue did make me laugh.  Lani Minella actually laughed in this one which is a rare event in ND games. You can check her talent out on a youtube video I recently found! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm1BGVfqWC0CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 87SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:The score was an excellent rendition of a classic, upscale French Society in the Age Of Reason.  Its light, lilting works trickled along amidst fine backings from harpsichords & strings.  The sound effects were adequate and the castle scenery was a solid job by the designers for the year it was made.CUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 88PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: I didnt find many in the game except locker combinations, lever & slider puzzles, but it was okay for what the game provided. Uniqueness and mini games would come in later ND editions.CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 87ADVENTURE ENDING: The way the culprit was caught was rather odd and unsatisfactory. I was confused on what exactly happened and scoffed at the simple and unexplainable way I had to catch them. Perhaps some French punishment should have been introduced :) instead. The climax in the Royal Tower was spectacular on a visual level and again you had to pay close attention to Nancys notes regarding what happened to everyone in the conclusion.  BTW: How is Nancy able to bounce around the castle in a good mood after being knocked unconscious hours earlier? Seems rather ridiculous to me.CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 86* PART 2 *I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were totake weeks! Well, it took me two days [7 hours] and I gave myself aDetective Score Of : 82My Strong Points: I guessed the culprit and have been on quite a run lately [14 correct out of 21 games]. I seemed to assimilate into the plot pretty well without being fooled into believing any side story that would skew my detective work. The puzzles were simple to complete and I noticed that similar puzzles were placed in later games.  I was able to deduce that I had to start the ski lift in order to be saved from the cold weather!My Weak Points: A walkthrough was used only a couple times just to check my game flow because HER had a sloppy time integrating the incident trigger tree properly.  In laymans terms, I completed tasks a couple hours ahead due to my prowess only to find out later that the character was still wondering how to do the SAME events just accomplished by asking other people!OVERALL GAME SCORE: 86 + 82/ 2 = 84 [ B ]BOTTOMLINE: I saw more written dialogue glitches [Bess [I believe] said someting instead of someTHING]. Overall, I learned only a bit more French history than I knew already, but for children, this is a fine starter education of European society.  I recommend it for that, but compared to the future games, it was rather simplistic.Thus far, on my list of the 21 completed ND games, TREASURE ranks.... # 5 !!!!!1) GHOST DOGS OF MOON LAKE * 88.52) THE SHATTERED MEDALLION * 873) GHOST OF THORNTON HALL * 86.54) HAUNTING CASTLE MALLOY * 85.55) TREASURE ROYAL TOWER  * 846) HAUNTED CAROUSEL  * 837) WHITE WOLF ICICLE CREEK * 82.58) DANGER DECEPTION ISLAND * 819) MESSAGE HAUNTED MANSION * 8010) WARNINGS AT WAVERLY * 7811) SHADOW AT WATERS EDGE * 77.512) THE CAPTIVE CURSE * 7713) SECRET SHADOW RANCH * 7614) TRAIL OF THE TWISTER * 7215) PHANTOM OF VENICE * 71.516) TOMB OF THE LOST QUEEN * 7117) THE SILENT SPY * 70.518) CURSE BLACKMOOR MANOR * 7019) ALIBI IN ASHES * 69.520) THE DEADLY DEVICE * 6921) SECRETS CAN KILL [REMAST] * 68", "unixReviewTime": "1410912000"}

I will admit it isnt the best game in the series, but thats ok by me. It isnt extremely difficult, but it isnt overly easy. The characters are all interesting (and this game introduces my favorite ND character, Professor Hotchkiss). I love history, and this game is full of that. But the best part about it? The exploring. I will admit that the movements are a little bit limited, but this is only the fourth game. They hadnt yet refined things. However, in this game, every time you progress (almost) you get to unlock a new area in the game. There are so many places to go in this little castle, so many things to see.  This game gave me so much to imagine, so much to think on, and, now that Im older, it gives me a ton of inspiration.To anyone that hasnt played this game, I highly recommend it. If youve played other games but not this one, Im completely shocked. You need to play this game NOW. And if youre looking for an introduction to the series, look no further. Treasure in a Royal Tower is a wonderful classic that I really hope will enthrall you as much as it has me these last ten years.", "unixReviewTime": "1338768000"}
{"overall": 4.0, "reviewerID": "A1543Y65HXSXZP", "asin": "B00005LVWL", "reviewText": "With certain recent games like WAC and SAW, its evident that with each and every Nancy Drew PC release, the graphics and voice acting get better and better. But sometimes, no matter how good the graphics are, they usually cant hide an empty storyline and a game in need of many touch ups. This game is an example of a decent edition to the series, and even though its not one of my favorites, it doesnt need makeup to make it shine.Story: 8.5/10. This game has a decent story that holds together pretty well. Much of the game centers around centuries old history, much of it on Marie Antoinette. Although you ended up learning a few things, the story was still very inticing and it wasnt like they were shoving all of the information down your throat.Graphics/Setting: 8/10. Im not going to rate a lot of this game on graphics, mainly because the graphics of today are automatically compared to these graphics, and considering this game and the new games were released a decade apart, I think its fair to somewhat disregard the graphics. I liked the setting, even though you stay in one place, and I like moving around more. But this castle was ginormous, and I had plenty of trouble just finding my room.Characters: 8/10. The characters this time all have pretty stand-out personalities. You have Dexter Egan, the caretaker of the building, Professor Hotchkiss, a hilarious if not somewhat annoying author who can never get Nancys name right, Lisa, a photojournalist, and Jacques Brunais, a french ski intructor. They all have a distinct personality, and are a great touch to the overall atmosphere.Puzzles: 7.5/10. Theyre werent that many puzzles, but the ones that were there were hard, but they fit the game.Exploration: 9/10. Exploring is a big part of this game, and I got lost a lot. The castle is so big, and theres plenty for you to explore and have an adventure in.Activities: 4/10. Activities werent really evident in the older games, and theyre werent any here either.Ending: 6.5/10. The ending was somewhat not surprising, and a pretty simple one too, yet it still gave me the goosebumps that good Nancy Drew PC endings give me. You people know what I mean.Total (averaged): 7.3 out of 10, rounded to....7.5/10.As a diehard Nancy Drew PC fan, I did enjoy this game, and it deserves a spot on any fans shelf.", "unixReviewTime": "1313798400"}
{"overall": 5.0, "reviewerID": "A3PD6NG6XL336W", "asin": "B00005LVWL", "reviewText": "With each passing Nancy Drew game, the games have gotten better. In the past three alone, theyve gone from containing great plots with terrible gaming quality (Secrets Can Kill) to awesome plots with incredible gaming quality (Message in a Haunted Mansion). Treasure in the Royal Tower is no exception, and definitely the best Nancy Drew game to the date of its release.Nancy is currently attempting to have some relaxing fun at a ski lodge called Wickford Castle in Butter Ridge, Wisconsin. Shortly after unpacking in her room, she goes downstairs to talk to the caretaker of the lodge. He informs her that Wickfords historic library has been vandalized, and is now off limits. Not only that, but another guest has reported a robbery in her room recently. Nancy decides to sneak around the castle to discover whats going on, only to discover that one of the towers at Wickford Castle was imported from France many years ago, and could hold a precious treasure that once belonged to Marie Antoinette herself. Its now up to Nancy to find this treasure before a would-be thief does...This is probably the strongest plot to appear in a Nancy Drew game at the time of Treasure in the Royal Towers release. I loved the setting, and the use of actual events and figures in history was an awesome idea. I learned quite a bit about Maries character while playing the game, and reading some fictional documents that were written by her (fictional meaning they were fictional, but real in this fictional game) really made me curious as to what kind of woman and queen she truly was. The game itself isnt all that scary, but since the past three were, its good to have one in which the scare factor was a little toned down (if they were all scary, then itd get boring after awhile).Like the previous game, this game does have a few chores that need to be done, but theyre very well-integrated into the game and dont get in the way of sleuthing. Nancy actually spends the vast majority of the game sneaking into hidden passageways, questioning suspects, and looking through confidential areas.While the graphics do show their age on occasion, theyre absolutely phenomenal regardless. I was in awe of the beauty and detail of the castle at times. The explorable areas outside were also very nicely detailed, especially the beautiful garden (covered in snow at the time of Nancys exploration). I wont say too much for the sake of spoiling this for those who have not played, but my favorite spot of all was the place in which Nancy finds what she and the culprit have been searching for. It was so beautifully detailed, and I could really feel all the awe that a real-life Nancy probably would have felt upon entering this hidden area.The cast in this game was definitely stronger than the casts in the previous three (though the last one does follow very closely). The first suspect mentioned is Dexter Egan, Wickford Castles elderly caretaker who seems to know more about the history surrounding the castle than hes admitting. Hes currently trying to take care of all the issues going on singlehandedly while the owner is away on business, and believes that the culprit must be somebody else in the castle. Lisa Ostrum is a photojournalist who enjoys gossiping and being buddy-buddy with Nancy, and tells Nancy that shed like to explore Maries tower to find out more about the history hidden beyond the castle walls. Jacques Brunais is the handsome French ski instructor at the castle whos currently engaged to an American woman and seems to hold a very special passion for French history.  Professor Beatrice Hotchkiss is an eccentric woman who spends almost all of her time typing in her room, doing research and writing out what she calls her theory (she is also the guest who claims to have been robbed).Like the last game, this game also should be praised for the perfect choice of the culprit in the end. All four of the characters had great motives, and all of them had enough evidence pointing toward them to make me suspect them at times. However, as the loose ends are gradually tied together and the story comes to an exciting end, only one particular suspect could logically be behind all of this. The culprits character was fantastic, and he/she is definitely one of the cruelest villains that Nancy Drew has ever faced.The games musical score is very nicely done. Music heard while exploring the hallways was super catchy, and definitely added to the overall castle feel in the game (in the sense that it sounded very stereotypically royal, for lack of better terms). The music occasionally got a little scarier while Nancy was exploring dark passageways or in the face of danger which could cost her life if she isnt fast enough to find a way out. There wasnt a track out of place, if you ask me.While the previous game is a close runner-up, Treasure in the Royal Tower was definitely the best Nancy Drew game at the time of its release. Some would even say that its still the best to date, and it remains in the top three as of the release of the Collectors Edition Fan Favorites packaging (along with The Secret of Shadow Ranch and Curse of Blackmoor Manor. Between the rich sense of history, awesome casting, wonderfully detailed settings, and great soundtrack, this surely remains one of Nans most memorable cases to date.

{"overall": 4.0, "reviewerID": "A13BTMCSLTQ48R", "asin": "B00005LVWL", "reviewText": "I was at the store when I saw this game on sale for really cheap, so I thought Hey, why not get it?. Id seen really good reviews for this game, but I was still kind of apprehensive because its such an old game, I thought the graphics would be really horrible. But I was surprised at what a quality game it is! Im going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.PLOT - 4.5/5: Nancys ski vacation is cut short when a blizzard keeps her stuck in the Wisconsin castle shes staying at. Apparently in the 1920s, some guy who really loved French castles decided to build one in Wisconsin, and even imported a tower from Marie Antoinettes castle to be added on to his. Nancy learns that Marie Antoinette was rumored to have left a treasure somewhere in the castle, so its up to her to find the treasure before someone else tears the castle apart trying to find it. I thought this was a really good plot, and everything else into the story tied into it nicely. I only wish it had been longer, it was a little shorter than I had hoped. But overall, I was impressed!CHARACTERS - 3.5/5: The characters include the castles caretaker, Dexter, who is very defensive and has a dark past, and Jacques, a famous French skier who was actually really fun to listen to. The hotels guests were Professor Hotchkiss, an eccentric old woman who studies French history, and Lisa, a photojournalist. Each of the characters had their own personalities and motives, which was good. The voice acting was good, too. My only problem was that the culprit was really obvious, like 20 minutes into the mystery I could tell who it was. That really bothered me, so Im going to have to knock off a couple of points for it.SETTING - 5/5: I loved the castle!! It was huge, I got lost plenty of times just trying to find my hotel room, haha. But there was tons to explore. Plus I was surprised how good the graphics were. I thought they might be kind of shabby because its an older game, but I was way off. And the music was really nice, some of the best music Ive heard in a Nancy Drew game.PUZZLES - 3/5: I felt there was a serious lack of puzzles in this game. Maybe this came out before Her Interactive got the idea of putting in filler puzzles to make the games longer. It was kind of nice not having to do a puzzle every second, but I do want to have SOME puzzles. There were probably less than a handfull of puzzles in the whole game, wich must have been why it was so short.IS IT CHALLENGING?: No. Like I said before theres only a few puzzles, and everything else is pretty easy. Id give it a 2 for challenge.ENDING - 5/5: The ending was good. It made perfect sense with the rest of the plot. The culprit isnt a surprise, but catching them was fun.FINAL SCORE:Plot: 4.5Characters: 3.5Setting: 5Puzzles: 3Challenge: 2Ending: 5= 23 divided by 6 = 3.8 rounded to 4.", "unixReviewTime": "1284854400"}

I am very happy that this was my first game, as it is not only, in my opinion, one of the best games in the Nancy Drew adventure game series, but it is also the perfect mix of mystery and intrigue.Story-You are on a ski vacation in Wisconsin when you get snowed in at the castle/resort in which you are staying.  You find out that the castle library has been vandalized, and you set out to find out who destroyed the beautiful library and why.  As you make your way through the game, you will also find that the story has quite a bit to do with the history of Marie Antoinette.Graphics-The graphics are improved from the earlier three games, as the 3D backgrounds have a bit more detail.  Also, the characters have been developed to move a bit more smoothly.Sound-The music in the game is very regal and pleasant to listen to.  The background sounds are also well done as they sound realistic.  As for the voice acting, this game has some actors/actresses that sound really good and interesting.Gameplay-First of all, like the games before it in the series, this is a first person point-and-click adventure game.  Although there is only one main location to explore (the castle) it is a very large location filled with many rooms to explore and many puzzles to solve.  The puzzles range from easy to hard, but they are all solvable without any need of a walkthrough.  The hint system is there for you, if you need it though, which basically consists of calling your friends on the phone to ask for a hint.  There are also four characters that you can interact with and interrogate, and they each have a unique and interesting personality.Length-This is definitely a game with some meat to it length-wise.  It will take you several hours to finish it, and hopefully, you will have fun with every second of it.If youre looking for an intriguing adventure game with fun puzzles and a great story, then this is the perfect game for you!", "unixReviewTime": "1260576000"}

Out of the four games Ive played (Final Scene, Secrets Can Kill, Message in a Haunted Mansion, Treasure in the Royal Tower), Treasure in the Royal Tower had the most satisfying plot, interesting characters, clever dialogue, and the most cool places to explore.Nancy is on vacation at a ski resort in Wisconsin built by an eccentric millionaire. The resort is built to look like a castle, complete with a tower that was imported from a chateau in France. French queen Marie Antoinette used to spend a good deal of time in the tower, and one of the hotel guests believes that the tower holds an important secret that could clear Marie Antoinettes name. When you arrive, a killer blizzard leaves everyone trapped in the castle, and the castles library has been vandalized. Besides yourself, there are a number of suspects: Jacques, the Olympic ski instructor, Lisa, the photojournalist, Dexter, the caretaker, and Mrs. Hotchkiss, the eccentric Marie Antoinette scholar. As the game progresses you will learn a great deal about French Revolutionary history and Marie Antoinette in particular.The locations in the game are varied and realistic: an imposing lobby, a comfy lounge with a blazing fireplace, the ransacked library, Nancys room, castle corridors that lead to dead ends, twisty stone stairwells, an antique elevator, a shed, a secret garden and the Royal Tower. Along the way youll slip along secret passageways, climb elevator shafts, and ascend into the Royal Tower to find Marie Antoinettes secret, but...BE CAREFUL. Someone doesnt want you to succeed in your search: you are deliberately trapped in the elevator, hit over the head, and locked outside to freeze to death. Only your quick thinking and detective skills can save Nancy!Buyer Beware:I *loved * this game, but I have to give it only three stars because I had HORRIBLE problems getting the game to run. It would crash constantly in the middle of conversations or leave me stuck at a certain point in a hallway before giving me an error message of Invalid CHUNK file. I had to restart the game 25-30 times before I could beat it, and it would cause my computer to crash as well. There is no patch available on HerInteractives website. I changed a number of settings and configurations and the problem didnt go away. The most frustrating thing was that it wouldnt let me beat the game: after the villain revealed their identity, a chase scene was supposed to follow, but the computer would never return control to me and the baddie got away every time. When I selected the Second Chance feature, the game would inevitably lock up and my computer would crash again. Very, very frustrating.", "unixReviewTime": "1049587200"}

It LOOKS a lot better than windows 2000 and other previous versions, and also it seems to load a lot faster than windows 2000. Which warrants my 2 star rating.The new set up in Windows XP is very cumbersome and sometimes downright confusing.  For those of us that are familiar with Win 2K you will find that many things are not in places where we are used to them being.  This is a small problem and im sure that I will become comfortable with it.  My main gripe is the constant application lock ups in this OS for no apparant reason.  For example if you happen to mistype a URL in Internet Explorer, then be prepared to have IE lock up for at least 45 seconds before windows decides to allow you to control IE again.  Same goes true for Outlook.  Sometimes Outlook will just lock up for no reason and either you have to wait it out, or just do a control-ALT-Delete to end the task which is believe it or not a lot quicker than waiting on windows.  Keep in mind my inbox only has 20 messages since I just started my job Monday.  Yet it still locks up and crashes for no reason.  To add fuel to the fire sometimes applications will just terminate with fatal errors and come up with a message box stating sorry for the inconvience and an option to send the error report to microsoft. HA!  It looks like Microsoft expected this OS to have a lot of problems (and that it does) and are using the customers to find all their bugs for them.  I wouldnt mind doing this for a pay check, but for free?  I dont think so.Ive only used XP for 4 days and already having a multitude of problems with constant lock ups and crashes.  I havent had the oppurtunity to do software installations on this OS, and frankly I dont want to, im sure that is also littered with bugs.

When Windows XP came out I obtained what I was really expecting, a very solid, stable and enhanceable system.Windows XP is based on the Windows 2000 code base with several major multimedia, administrative tools and security enhancements among other things.This is really the closest you can get to a truly standard OS for all types of users, except system administators obviously.  We are getting closer to not having different Windows flavors running around anymore.The acceptance of this OS will gradually relieve developers from having to design multi-platform applications, a major headache in the past.  As of this writing, Windows 95 has almost been phased out, and almost every piece of software is written for Windows XP (Home and Professional)Ive tested this OS on my personal laptop (Thinkpad T-21) and several Pentium family desktops (P-III 750Mhz and P-IV 2.4Ghz) with many different software and hardware combinations without major issues.  Software drivers are becoming quickly available for all types of hardware.  In terms of software applications, I had to wait a bit longer for a few applications to become XP compatible.As with any OS, the compatibility issues were higher when the OS was released, but now you will not find as many, unless you still own very old pieces of hardware and software.  This is in my opinion the primary factor when deciding wether to upgrade or to stay where you are.I will not get into the features of the OS, as they are very well described by Amazon and other reviewers, what I can tell you is what I consider the major highlights of this OS:* Great multimedia features - MovieMaker, Media Player.  Windows Explorer has also been expanded with options to manage digital media such as pictures and music.  Multimedia devices are installed and configured easier than ever* CD Burning options built in - Creating a music or data CD is as easy as drag and drop.  It may not be the most efficient burning system, but its a good place to start* Administrative Tools - The Disk administrator, along with the disk defragmenter are two enhanced tools that I rely on with XP* Windows Update - Microsoft has been updating the OS frequently with many security fixes and tools updates and enhancements. You can set up XP to update your system periodically* Networking - Setting up a network is much easier now.  A firewall is also built in as part of the network security features new in XP* System Help - The help tool has been enhanced to search not only locally on the PC but through the Internet as well.  General Help Topics are very detailed and descriptive with many illustrations.  Great improvement here.* Wizards - Many more settings are performed with wizards.  Is like filling an electronic questionnaire, then XP takes over the rest of the configuration steps based on your answers.And simply the looks.  Icons are more colorful, and they take  advantage of higher end video cards with more color options.  You can select display settings to look like the old Windows or the new XP look.In terms of performance, I admit that Windows by design, does not consider low end machines and it may seem slow on low RAM machines.  I would definitely recommend having more than 256MB of RAM and a high end Pentium processor (P3 and up) for acceptable performance.  Fortunately, there are options to tweak performance settings by eliminating the sometimes unnecessary display effects.I think at this time, you may be assured that Windows XP will be the best choice for you.  Dont hesitate to buy it, taking into consideration the points I mentioned above.Recommended", "unixReviewTime": "1043107200"}

Certain features such as Administrative tools (turned on by default in XP Pro) would not be recommended for a family PC, if you have a child and he or she enters the Administrative tools and alters any component of the services feature, it can totally ruin your PC.

In addition to a new look, it offers stability, ease of use and more Internet integration than ever before.Installation was easy. You can either upgrade your existing Windows or do a clean install. I recommend a clean install so be sure to back up your important data (e-mail, accounting programs, etc.) You can boot from the CD and it will pretty much to the rest. Installation takes about 30-60 minutes but it was VERY easy. XP really knows what plug and play means. ALL, and I mean ALL of my peripherals were found and configured automatically.Once installed, you will be prompted to activate. This was an easy and fast process. The next thing it will do is set up your Internet access. Once this is done, you are now ready to go. You will notice right away that the interface is different and very colorful. It may take a little while to get used to but once you do, you will like it. You also have an option of a classic Windows 9x view.Windows XP makes a lot of functions very easy. First of all, depending on your BIOS and motherboard, you can tell Windows just what to do when you press your power button. It also has built in CD burning capability, however, to delete a file from a CD-RW, you must erase the CD and then put back the files you want. A little inconvenient but a lot more stable than DirectCD. It is VERY easy to set up individual users. You can set up a personalized account for each member of the family. Also, when installing many programs, it will detect XP and ask if you want certain people to access the program. This is very nice and secure. And with Internet Explorer 6.0, you can now choose the level of cookie protection. You will be amazed on how many third party usage tracking cookies that are placed on your PC.Backward compatibly is very good to excellent with XP. XP ran all of my older windows based programs and MOST of my DOS games. A few DOS games worked about 80% and some not at all. I am sure that DOS EMULATORS will be available for purchase in the near future.Windows XP seemed designed for Internet integration. Just about every major function in XP has a tie to the Internet. And because of this, Microsoft has included a built in Firewall. It is good, but I would recommend Norton Internet Security 2002.For those of you who are worried about compatibility, Windows XP makes it pretty easy to set up a dual boot. All you need is a partition created before installing. After that, Windows does the rest.For those who want security, go with Windows XP Professional. Everyone else can get by with Windows XP Home. If you have a previous copy of Windows, get the UPGRADE version. It will search for a previous install or ask you for the original Windows 9.x/2000 disk to verify.There is a lot more I can say about Windows XP but you just need to see it for yourself.

Additionally it comes with the option of converting it to a Windows 98SE desktop appearance, for those who dont want to fuss with learning new instructions to get the old things done. It does so much more though.  One note of caution; do not install XP in an older machine, with older hardware. Your sound card vendor may have stopped making software drivers a long time ago for your now discontinued device. The problem is that they do not want to spend the resources to create drivers for a product that they no longer make. So if you have an old video card, audio card, modem, etc, it quite possibly wont work with XP. If you try to install XP you will get all kinds of incompatible error messages. So do yourself a favor and put old wine into old bottles, and new wine into new ones; consider getting a newer machine if you are going to upgrade to XP. You might wind up spending close to the same amount of money upgrading your components to make it work, as you would to just simply buy a new one.

As a writer, I was forced to save documents no less than once for each new sentence, and at touchy moments, literally every few words.Most important, the program is highly susceptible to viruses and hackers. Preventing these two problems requires expensive add-on software and hardware.True enough, the built-in firewall OUGHT to work. But in my case, hackers got in anyway -- four times in six months. With this software, I suffered repeated break ins, the last of which cost me some primary data and several of my original poems. Even installing service pack 2 did not help.After the last go-round, I was forced to hire an expensive data recovery guru --- another story in itself --- but was still unable to recover everything lost.Throughout this six-month nightmare, I repeatedly reinstalled the XP program, including, more than once, service pack 2. That, however, didnt plug the security leaks. My computer was completely compromised. In the end, I had to junk the machine all together.In my experience, Mac and Linux operating systems are both far superior.Now Ive got one Windows machine --- a laptop purchased in early 2007 at or around the release of Service Pack 3 --- to run a BioFeedback program whose authors, unfortunately, had not created a Linux version.Admittedly, Microsofts final XP service pack seems to have plugged XPs most serious security holes.

I use Windows 2000 at work and I have to say that XP is by far the best choice for the home PC.  I did the XP Upgrade and I must say that is was extremely easy to convert my 98 system to XP.  I takes A L-O-N-G time to do the install (a single cd, yet prepare to spend about 2 hours once you hit go).MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER....If you do nothing else to prepare for the upgrade; take the time to run the hardware & software compatibility check before you commit yourself to the install.  This is most critical & heres a good example.  The driver for my PCs modem/chipset was incompatible with XP.  This was highlighted when I ran the test and it allowed me to retrieve the updated driver before launching the upgrade.  If I had not done this, then I would have been toast.  After the upgrade I would not have been able to use my modem to access the internet to get the new driver after the fact.  So do yourself a favor, run the test, print it out, get all your patches beforehand & youll save yourself a ton of frustration and wasted time.Other than that its great and very easy to load.  They did a great job with the user interface and instructions.  It was a no brainer to install.

Even after I checked compatibility, some programs I had were non-functioning after the upgrade and some I had to install again.  (2) Download the most recent drivers for all your hardware to avoid problems.  I didnt do this and when I upgraded, I lost my sound card drivers because they werent compatible with XP and the XP disc didnt have the new drivers I needed to make my sound card work, so I had to find my sound card manufacturers website and download an XP compatible driver.You are really better off waiting until you buy a new computer to get XP.

Many of my friends hate XP for this reason, but Ive learned to live with it, just as I did with all its predecessors.  Other than that, I really like a lot of the other features, and pretty much all the new toys and MS add-ins are XP-only, so its worth the upgrade, (if nothing else), to avoid becoming obsolete.

While I experienced some lockups and freezing, it didnt happen that often.  What prompted me to switch to XP was a desire for better memory management (Windows 98 doesnt do a very good job), more stability even though Win98 wasnt bad for me, and an overall change of scenery.  So finally I made the plunge, doing a clean install instead of trying to upgrade over 98.The Upgrade Advisor that you can download from Microsoft.com was very useful.  Luckily everything except my NEC printer was compatible with XP.  Next, the Transfer Settings and Files Wizard that comes on the XP disk also came in handy.  It gathers all your settings and/or files from the old computer, saves them in a file (or transfers them directly - you have various options) which you can then put on the new computer.  I wound up transferring only settings using the wizard.  Originally I told it to transfer files too, but it copied too many things that were unnecessary and the result was way too big to fit on a cd.  I would advise copying your documents and other important files manually but letting XP transfer your settings.  That way you can be more selective about what gets transferred (assuming you are doing a clean install).Installation of XP went very smoothly.  It identified all my hardware, and I was able to reinstall my software with no problems.  Using the Transfer Wizard to move the settings to the new installation worked fine and was a real time saver - it moved all of my internet and e-mail settings and messages over with ease.  All user input was very clearly explained and the process overall was quite simple.Using XP: Theres a lot I still have to learn, but so far the system has been stable and I notice memory is managed much better than under 98.  It loads faster and while the much more colorful layout took some getting used to, now it seems like 98 is in black and white by comparison.  I also use the clear type option for fonts and find that they are easier to read than under a normal display (it seems to me that the main difference is that clear type makes it darker and bolder).Im glad I made the switch.  Ive read some complaints about installation experiences and also the strict registration requirements but my experience so far has been all positive (knock on wood, of course!).

Its as if we were led to believe for years that even a modicum of stability and interoperability were too much to ask for.  And we were.  The government needs no better proof of why a monopoly is bad for consumers than to add up all the crashes, incompatibilities, and lousy performance results that Windows has chocked up over the past twenty years.  Pathetic.  Those in the know will tell you that Windows has kept a cottage industry of computer technicians and troubleshooters gainfully (and lucratively) employed; to them, it has been the goose that laid the golden egg.  A big, fat egg.Now we have XP.  Its only been out a short time, but it seems to be far more stable than its predecessors.  Its about time.  It still crashes from time to time and gets buggy when you try to plug and play various peripherals, but those problems havent led to system meltdown yet.  Thankfully.  But we should have had an operating system like this from Microsoft years and years ago.  There is nothing technologically innovative or superior about Windows XP.  It simply works pretty well and most people should be happier with their computers than theyve ever been.

Fingers crossed, it seems to actually be an operating system that isnt an Edsel.)But there are operating systems out there that are well-ahead of Windows XP.  Mac OS X is such an operating system.  Much easier to use.  Much more stable.  Much more elegant.  Yet, because of the entrenched Windows monopoly, few give it a chance.  But, today, there is no reason to stick with Windows.  The new Mac OS is completely compatible with any Windows network (Mac OS X is based on UNIX, which is the most time-tested stable operating system ever, and also the basis for the industrial LINUX operating system), has all the popular programs that work on Windows (including a marvelous new Office for Mac X that bests the Windows version of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Entourage).

I recommend a clean install so be sure to back up your important data (e-mail, accounting programs, etc.) You can boot from the CD and it will pretty much to the rest. Installation takes about 30-60 minutes but it was VERY easy. XP really knows what plug and play means. ALL, and I mean ALL of my peripherals were found and configured automatically.Once installed, you will be prompted to activate. This was an easy and fast process. The next thing it will do is set up your Internet access. Once this is done, you are now ready to go. You will notice right away that the interface is different and very colorful. It may take a little while to get used to but once you do, you will like it. You also have an option of a classic Windows 9x view.Windows XP makes a lot of functions very easy. First of all, depending on your BIOS and motherboard, you can tell Windows just what to do when you press your power button. It also has built in CD burning capability, however, to delete a file from a CD-RW, you must erase the CD and then put back the files you want. A little inconvenient but a lot more stable than DirectCD. It is VERY easy to set up individual users. You can set up a personalized account for each member of the family. Also, when installing many programs, it will detect XP and ask if you want certain people to access the program. This is very nice and secure. And with Internet Explorer 6.0, you can now choose the level of cookie protection. You will be amazed on how many third party usage tracking cookies that are placed on your PC.Backward compatibly is very good to excellent with XP. XP ran all of my older windows based programs and MOST of my DOS games. A newer Windows game didnt work correctly but all it took was to make it run in Windows98/ME compatibility mode and it fixed it. A few DOS games worked about 80% and some not at all. I am sure that DOS EMULATORS will be available for purchase in the near future.Windows XP seemed designed for Internet integration. Just about every major function in XP has a tie to the Internet.

If you have a previous copy of Windows, get the UPGRADE version. It will search for a previous install or ask you for the original Windows 9.x/2000 disk to verify.There is a lot more I can say about Windows XP but you just need to see it for yourself.

I run XP on three computers in my home via a home network, and I have literally never seen the dreaded Blue Screen.  While both Windows 98 (which I thought was a pretty good OS) and Windows ME (horrible!!!) require frequent re-booting, XP does not.  You can go weeks, even months, without rebooting XP.

We run one notebook (via a wireless connection base station hub) and two desktops via XP, and you can literally set something like this up in less than an hour, counting hardware hookups.

Most worked OK out of the box, but upgraded drivers are available from most vendors via the internet.Speaking of the Internet, XP is truly dependent upon the Internet, and I would imagine that a user without Internet access would find XP very difficult to use.  XP is among the new generation of software of which Internet access is an integral design assumption.  The OS uses the Internet to register itself, obtain updates, and obtain drivers.  This is reflective of a trend whereby in my opinion every computer installation will in a very real way have as its centerpiece the Internet connection of the user.  Dial-ups days are numbered too--XP files, like most files nowadays, are simply too large for a 56K dial-up modem.In my opinion Microsoft hit a home run with Windows XP, almost enough to cause me to forgive them for Windows ME, which was absolutely awful.  If you are using ME, RUN, dont walk, to upgrade.", "unixReviewTime": "1054684800"}

It is simply the best, hands down.  I even like it better for using Photoshop and Illustrator than a Mac and that statement is virtually heresy in the art world! First, it is not buggy and not crash prone.  It reliably works all of the time.  Windows 2000 was very good in that regard and XP is even better. 95 and 98 were terrible regarding crashes and reliability. Im also using Windows Media Player 9 with it, which is a terrific player, and Im even able to use all wma files (1/3 the size) rather than mp3 after using a converter. I stopped using Real Player after getting on this Player 9, which works the best with XP.  Second, if I need help on something on my computer, I can have my friend in a different city, also on XP, take over my controls using the Net Meeting feature.  He was able to reinstall a program for me that was giving me fits.  Third, there are loads of special programs that work especially in conjunction with XP that further enhance it, such as Firegraphic 5 where you can see all your images and view them in filmstrips, slide shows and big versions. And thats just one of many special programs that Ive used on XP.  It is also a delight to go to any website and find that whatever you can download there is compatible with XP.  One thing that would really turn me off a Mac, by contrast, is the notice on many programs or features on the web that they havent developed a version yet for a Mac.  I also like the way Windows Explorer works in XP and that it looks better than in any earlier version of Windows.  As my giant file cabinet, it is very easy for me to keep everything organized in WE and the thumbnails of my jpgs, tifs, ais, htms and so forth are terrific.  The task bar is much improved from 2000 and I found I could even get rid of my pop up remover program because XP makes it so easy to close multiple browser windows with one right click on the task bar on a grouped browser window button. I also get beautiful thumbnails now when I use right click.  There is a wonderful XP magazine that comes from the UK (called simply Windows XP) that I would love to see Amazon have available for subscription.

What is with those cinnabar handprints and why is she in another mystery!?? Cant a girl catch a break?INITIAL SCORE: 83CHARACTERS:Joanna Riggs: The original curator of the museum that is hanging on to her job after indiscriminate past dealings with finding rare artifacts.  She is hard-nosed with things running correctly and I found her type pretty typical in this career position.  I dont feel she is as moral as she wants to seem, but since she isnt bothering me, I overlook that for the most part.  I never considered her a culprit.Henrik van der Hune: A epigrapher that took a tumble on the indoor temple steps. I had to help restore his memory and always felt he was both a straight-laced boring personality to an outright professional in his career.  I never thought he could be the culprit.Taylor Sinclair: An art dealer in close connection with Johanna. This is the epitome of the sleazy criminal look with the thin mustache, shallow chin, and greasy hair. I didnt know if HER was putting up a facade with an obvious guilty caricature so I was 50/50 in my decision.Alejandro del Rio:  The U.S. ambassador to the mexican  consulate; he seems firm on righting wrongs that have taken precious artifacts out of the hands of his home country. He was my top option as the culprit because he seemed too handsome and proper somehow for the anger that could be felt beneath his demeanor.BESS/GEORGE/HARDY BOYS PHONE CONTACTS:  The girls were entertaining as always, but there was only so much they could actually help me with; same for the boys but on an even lesser level.CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 82SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:The music was pretty uptempo and brought one into the mysteries of the Mayan culture.  Graphics were pristine for that early game design period.  Out in the museum garden, those bird noises were pretty unique. Was that a crested Guan?CUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 84PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: The three levels of the Mayan temple reserved for fill-in answer quizzes, basket hoop throwing, and the BUL game, kept my interest for the time being, but they weret challenges that you would describe as overly fascinating. The audio translation match was intriguing because it also helped you learn about the Mayans throughout the entirety of the museum which gave this particular adventure more of a learning series edge.CUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 85GENERAL IOTAS: I wouldnt call that corpse in the monolith a mummy [arent those properly prepared?].  Why was a missing part of the escape challenge in the Whisperers mouth? Doesnt make sense.  Also, why was the culprit using that scarlet hand imprint? I never got any explanation of why that was significant.CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 84ADVENTURE ENDING: I read too much into how tricky HER might be in this adventure, but it turned out not that much. Why were all three of the innocent characters awaiting me as I exited the monolith? That was a weird situation in which I would want some answers on how this came to be.CUMUL SCORE: Even = 84* PART 2 *I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were totake weeks! Well, it took me four days [12 hours] and I gave myself aDetective Score Of : 62My Strong Points: My memory was pretty impressive by memorizing the facts of Mayan culture meant for the quizzes and my adeptness at puzzling the pottery and key parts together was there.My Weak Points: To save on time, I used a walkthrough only to bridge me from one part of the plot to another without delay. Um, I used this a LOT.OVERALL GAME SCORE: 84 + 62/ 2 = 73 [ C - ]BOTTOMLINE: I was pretty bored I must admit, but not because the game was poorly designed. I think that anything that has a setting being museum-focused is bound to make me stare out the window wanting for better days.

{"overall": 4.0, "reviewerID": "A13BTMCSLTQ48R", "asin": "B000066ST3", "reviewText": "For some reason in all the years Ive been playing these games, when it came time to pick out which title to play next I always skipped over Secret of the Scarlet Hand. I dont know why, but I always just assumed that I wouldnt like this game. Maybe its because its notoriously educational (and who wants a game that is like school?) or maybe its because the previews for it arent terribly interesting. Whatever the case, Nancy Drew has once again proved me wrong. My intuition on these games must be seriously off, because every game Im sure I wont like ends up being one of my favorites. And this has indeed become one of my favorites of the early Nancy Drew titles. Im going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.PLOT - 5/5: Nancy is hired as the Deputy Curator at a Washington, DC museum called Beech Hill. It is quite an exciting time for Beech Hill because they are preparing to open a new exhibit on the Maya, the highlight of which will be a very rare (and very expensive) artifact - a large elaborately carved stone called a monolith.But poor Nancy just has the worst luck when it comes to vacations and dream jobs. Before she knows it, Beech Hill is robbed of one of its most beloved artifacts; a rare and unusual jade carving of the Mayan King Pacal. It seems to be related to a string of art thefts happening across the country, since in all the incidents Mayan jade artifacts were the target and a threatening red handprint was left at the scene.I thought this plot was just wonderful. It was well thought out, thorough, and unique among other ND titles. The length was perfect; I finished it over the course of a few days. There were lots of little twists and turns that I really enjoyed. It was interesting and intriguing, and very educational. Let me repeat that; it was VERY educational. It is set in a museum, after all. There is tons of information to take in - some of which is vital to the mystery of some of which is not. I have always loved history and am especially interested in the Maya and Aztec so this game was just my cup of tea. But if you dont like history - or arent a big fan of plenty of reading in a ND game - this game might not be for you.CHARACTERS - 4/5: Suspects in this game include Joanna Riggs, the curator of Beech Hill and therefore Nancys boss, a fairly serious young woman with a history of being a bit too eager to acquire artifacts for the museum. Henrik van der Hune is the museums resident expert in translating Mayan glyphs, so he is arguably the only person in the museum who can guess an artifacts true value. Then there is Taylor Sinclair, an art dealer located in DC, who often does business with Joanna and appears to be unusually concerned over the museums safety. Finally, there is Alejandro del Rio, a Mexican ambassador who accuses Beech Hill and other museums like it of flat-out stealing artifacts that rightfully belong to Mexico.Phone friends include Bess and George, the Hardy Boys, and Franklin Rose, who is a member of the Beech Hill board of directors and friend of Nancys father. There are quite a few one or two time phone friends related to the plot as well.Unfortunately, the four suspects werent very memorable. Their personalities were not particularly well defined and there wasnt anything quirky or fun about them. Worst of all, none of them were very suspicious. Basically, no one from this cast of characters is going to be making my favorites list anytime soon. However, the previous deputy curator, Sonny Joon, seen only in notebooks he left behind at the museum, was absolutely hilarious and his notebooks were a delightful comic relief. I hear he shows up again in some of the newer titles so Im really looking forward to that.SETTING - 5/5: The setting was excellent. Beech Hill was very interesting and there was tons to look at inside. If it were a real museum I would definitely visit. Other places to see include Nancys hotel room, Taylors office, Alejandros office, as well as some other locations that are unlocked throughout the course of the game. One thing that really blew me away was how realistic it all was. There were little things - like how could you see the exterior of every building before you entered it - that made a huge difference. It was so easy to get into the mystery because it really felt like I was there.PUZZLES - 4.5/5: I liked the puzzles, though this game tended to repeat itself as far as puzzles go. In other words, you do the same thing a few times throughout the game. The puzzles in the museum were mostly information scavenger hunts, where Nancy would be posed with a quiz question and you would have to search the museum exhibits for the answer. That didnt bother me, but I could easily understand someone finding it tedious and too slow-paced. In hindsight this game wasnt as puzzle-heavy as some other ND titles, which worked for me as Im not a huge puzzle fan. But the puzzles did work in seamlessly with the plot and I never felt like I was stuck doing something unnecessary just to make the game longer.IS IT CHALLENGING? Not really. Most - if not all - of the puzzles are explained by the game, and Nancy can call her friends for hints. I did go online for help once for a game of chance that I lost maybe 20 times in a row, thinking that there might be some strategy I was missing. But it seems that the mini-game couldnt be won until you reached a certain point in the plot, which frankly was pretty frustrating to learn I had wasted all that time. Anyways, I would give it a 3 for challenge.ENDING - 3.5/5: The ending was probably the only part of this game that really didnt impress me. Although the ending was very intense, it was just sort of awkward and didnt make a whole lot of sense. The culprit wasnt too predictable and their motive made sense. Overall the ending was underwhelming. But be warned that the ending of this game is pretty creepy, and because of it I definitely wouldnt recommend this game for young children.FINAL SCORE:Plot: 5Characters: 4Setting: 5Puzzles: 4.5Challenge: 3Ending: 3.5= 25, divided by 6 = 4.16 rounded to 4 stars", "unixReviewTime": "1373155200"}

It still manages to be extremely adventurous even though youre in the downtown of a big city rather than out in a castle, or a haunted mansion. The knowledge gained in this game is interesting, which is what makes the learning worth while. Just make sure you actually have a notebook sitting out to take notes.My favorite part of this game is its ending. Its hinted at a little bit, but when I first played through this game I never would have guessed at what would happen. As a kid, this ending scared me worse than the Ghost Dogs (of Moon Lake) ever could (I should mention that I got into these games just before this and Ghost Dogs was released, and Message in a Haunted Mansion didnt scare me because I -correctly- guessed at what was going on rather early, since Id seen it so often before on Scooby Doo).I mark it as my fourth favorite (1. Treasure, 2. Blackmoor, 3. Shadow at Waters Edge, 4. this one, 5. Danger on Deception Island) and I understand why some people might get frustrated and want to put it down.

Whether its a haunted mansion, or a ranch or even a train, HERInteractive takes on a new form of fun with each additional mystery, and while Secret of the Scarlet Hand is an older game in the series, and definitely not one of my favorites, there is still fun to be had with it, and orginiality is clearly evident.Story: 6.5/10. Nancy lands an internship at a museum in Washington D.C, which is devoted to the Mayan culture and will soon be exhibiting a newly discovered monolith to the public. But, shortly before the exhibition, one of the museums most treasured pieces is stolen from the museum, as well as a strange accident that occurs involving the museums epigrapher. It definitely wasnt one of my favorite plots, but was still somewhat interesting.Setting: 6.5/10. It was definitely an interestingly original idea to have a Nancy Drew game take place in a museum specializing in Mayan culture. You also get to hope on a subway to visit other characters offices, a hospital and Nancys hotel room. I personally thought that the museum was pretty boring, but maybe less boring as the game progressed, and I found things I didnt know were there before.Characters: 6/10. The characters were pretty annoying this time around. The epigrapher who got amnesia was very irritating to care to and talk to, Taylor Sinclair, an art specialist, was very annoying, and Alejandro, an ambassador to the Mexican Consolate, was even more annoying to talk to.Puzzles: 8.5/10. The puzzles were good this time around, and the only reason Im saying this is that theres a pyramid inside the museum, and on each level on this part of the museum, there are different quizzes and games that you have to complete to progress to the next floor. This was a big part of the game and I LOVED it.Activities: 6/10. There werent that many activities, but the games in the pyrmaid were decent.Ending: 6.5/10. The ending was obvious, and what you had to do to end the game was kind of confusing, and took me a few tries to get it right.Total (averaged): 6.6 out of 10, averaged to....6.5/10.Although this game does have some originality and fun, its too bland and boring for my taste, and Id recommend new HERInteractive fans to go with another purchase for now.", "unixReviewTime": "1313798400"}

The follow-up of The Final Scene continues to offer some great gaming with complex puzzles, intense plots, and some cool characters. While I prefer the previous three games, Secret of the Scarlet Hand is a good game, and among the most important games in the series.Nancy has decided to take a break and head out for an internship at Beech Hill Museum in Washington, D.C. Her dads friend, Franklin Rose, has spoken with the Board of Directors to set this up for her, and shell be working with several other experts of Mayan culture to set up Beech Hills new exhibit, featuring a jade carving of the Mayan King Pacal and ancient monolith that was recently excavated from Mexico. While Nancys internship starts off peaceful, Beech Hill soon becomes victim of a burglary! After the theft, Nancy finds a piece of paper with a gruesome scarlet hand left in the place of the now-missing Pacal carving. While investigating, she learns that a series of similar thefts have occurred around the country. Nancys now determined to retrieve the carving and catch this thief red-handed.The setting was great, and unlike any thats been seen in a Nancy Drew game before (or since). While there is more limited exploration, the areas that were able to be explored were nicely decorated and fully-interactive. I liked walking through the temple of Maya games and playing them all, as well as exploring other areas in Washington D.C. The abundant exploration that was in the previous three installments is definitely lacking here, though. There were several locations that didnt serve much of a purpose in the game (save to talk with a specific suspect) and the museum lacked any secret passageways. Regardless, the places that the suspects are conversed with are very nicely detailed and I rather enjoyed seeing different areas and buildings in Washington, D.C. while living vicariously through Nancy.Some of the chores were rather tedious, such as matching up an exhibit with its correct recording. However, chores like these were the exception instead of the rule. Most of the games were rather entertaining, especially the maze and ancient Mayan games.The suspects are probably the most disappointing aspect in this game. They include the museum curator, Joanna Riggs, Henrik Van Der Hume, the artifact expert, Alejandro del Rio, the attach to the Mexican Consulate, and Taylor Sinclair, the art dealer who helped Joanna get her hands on several of the artifacts that will soon be put on display. As a whole, the suspects are rather flat and unable to be conversed with much. Joanna is especially guilty of this, as her character definitely borders on useless. Most questions Nancy asks her, she answers with something along the lines of Henrik can help you with that. Taylor and Alejandro are hardly much better when it comes to development, only serving to be conversed with once every so often and not providing much insight into the case. On the contrary, Henrik was awesome and nicely developed, and he winds up playing a very large role in the game itself.While three of the four suspects werent very developed, they all did have some great motives to be the culprit in the end. Even though I didnt see this culprit coming when I first played the game, I see in hindsight that he/she is truly the most logical choice. This is definitely another game in which I cannot see anybody but the guilty party as the culprit in the end.As stated before, the suspects werent very nicely integrated. The phone friends, on the other hand, were very well scripted and employed. I loved all of the conversations that Nancy has on the phone with people, as they were humorously and cleverly composed. Most importantly, several characters that play important roles in the Nancy Drew series as a whole make their first appearance in this game, including Frank and Joe Hardy (AKA The Hardy Boys), Poppy Dada, Prudence Rutherford, and Sonny Joon. This is also the first game to feature the name of the Krolmeister company, which will play a substantial role in the games to come.The music was definitely different when compared to other games, in that it has more of a historical and nature feel to it, while the soundtracks of other games were more mysterious and elegant. This, however, is a bonus for this game. While previous games have focused on bandits, royalty, and magicians, this game focuses on the ancient Mayan civilization. The soundtrack was great for a museum filled with the histories of these ancient people, and all the tracks certainly felt in place.Is Secret of the Scarlet Hand my favorite Nancy Drew game of all time? No. Does it rank high on the list, though? Most definitely. While I did prefer the previous three games, this one certainly holds up to the high standards that the Nancy Drew series has set for itself. The plot is wonderful, and ultimately leads to an unforgettable and heart-pounding encounter that I never saw coming. Certainly cant wait to write about the next game all because of this one! :)", "unixReviewTime": "1308873600"}

Other than that its a great game, and I have the following comments on it:Story-You have a summer internship working at a Mayan museum in Washington D.C.  For those of you who dont know, the Mayan civilization was an Indian civilization that vanished without a trace.  Anyway, you are doing basic chores when a certain artifact is stolen, and a scarlet hand print is left at the scene of the crime.  Hence the title.  Eventually, you solve this mystery only to have another one thrown at you in the middle of the game, so you are actually getting 2 stories in 1.Graphics-These are pretty good graphics, with the backgrounds looking pretty real.  The characters still look definitely fake, but this has pretty good graphics still.Sound-The music is okay with kind of a Mayan twist on it, but the voice acting really isnt that great.  And the lips are REALLY off.  I ignore it, and it doesnt bother me, but others it might bother a little bit.Gameplay-The gameplay is exactly the same as the others in the series.  It is first person point-and-click.  You ride a metro system to get places, and the alarm clock is back, allowing you to go to sleep and wake up anytime you want.  The puzzles in this game are a little more difficult and numerous than in other games, and some of them are quite boring, but most are fun, and I can forgive the ones that arent.Fun-This game is pretty fun, but unlike the other games where there is just a tad bit of learning mixed in among the mystery, in this game, prepare to learn a LOT about Mayan history.  I hated it, because I hate history, but my friend loved it because he likes history.  I think the producers were just trying to appeal to history lovers as well as mystery lovers in this game, and I understand that.  No bad enough to give 3 stars, but not good enough for 5.Length-Oh.  My.  Goodness.  This is a rather long game.  It took me several months to finish, and whenever I replay it (which is a lot) it will take me about 12-15 hours because I still have trouble with some of the puzzles!The puzzles are hard, but the answers are in the game, you just have to look for them.  The history is boring, but the story is great!

In this adventure Nancy is the new deputy curator at Beech Hill Museum in Washington D.C. The museum is almost ready to open its most impressive exhibit: a large collection of priceless Maya artifacts on loan from the Mexican government and private collectors. But shortly before the opening, one of the prized jade carvings is stolen from under Nancys nose. The only clue is a vivid red handprint and a message in Maya glyphs left by the thief.First, let me say that, as someone who is seriously considering a masters degree in museum studies, this game was an absolute delight! The museum is filled with nooks and crannies to explore: the curators office, the exhibition hall, a three-storey Maya temple, gardens, shipping and receiving and the lab, filled with neat gadgets such as an analyzer, foam packing machine, ham radio and more, all of which help Nancy on her quest.Secret of the Scarlet Hand simply offers more locations than previous games, more characters/suspects, and a much deeper storyline. Nancy travels to different locations by subway, with a static image overlay as the various station lights light up on the metro map. Graphics are, as always, beautiful. The Maya artifacts are photo realistic, extremely detailed and vibrant. Music and ambient sounds are more pronounced than in previous ND games. The score features haunting panpipes, rainforest birdcalls, and flamenco, along with more ominous mood music-although some reviewers though the music was too repetitive, I found that the soundtrack greatly enhanced the gaming experience.This is definitely the most educational of the Nancy Drew games. Players must write down references to Mayan language, religion, rulers and more since there are three temple quizzes that Nancy must pass to progress in the game. Since it is set in a museum, the educational elements fit right into the game world without seeming out of place. Scarlet Hand is also the most difficult of the ND games to date, relying on a great deal of snooping, reading, Morse code transmissions in Spanish, telephone calls, and beating puzzles to progress in the investigation, but the great story and characters make it worth it.  Parents may find themselves roped into aiding investigations and end up playing the game themselves-there is plenty of variety in the various puzzles and tasks to keep the game interesting. Once again, Her Interactive has provided young girls with a positive, nonviolent role model in Nancy, and Scarlet Hand will be sure to thrill Nancy Drew/mystery fans, museum fans, and anyone looking for an engaging cultural journey. Not just for kids, Secret of the Scarlet Hand is an intelligent, gorgeous mystery with Mexican flavour and intrigue.", "unixReviewTime": "1057795200"}

Each game is full of clues, puzzles, and exciting (and possibly dangerous) adventures. Scarlet Hand is no exception.

Youll talk to various people, all the while knowing that one of them could be the thief.

There are a lot of facts to write down and recall, and the puzzles in this game are very original. I was very pleased with the number of puzzles; just the right amount. What I really liked about this game, in comparison to some of the other Nancy Drew games, was that you didnt have to maneuver your mouse so much to find things. In some of the other games, you can only see objects if you position your cursor at just the right angle turning just the right direction. In this game, everything was very out in the open and the game was easy to maneuver; surprisingly, however, that didnt make the game any less challenging than its predecessors.

Secondly, Money 2003 didnt remove key functionality that its predecessors sometime did -- so if you use an older version of Money, the features you like are still there.  Thirdly, you can batch epayments together and send them all at once (conversely, Money 2002 sent a payment by piecemeal, which was extremely slow and frustrating).

If there is something you dont like about Money, in all likelihood, there is an Options setting that will correct the problem.  For example, to remove sponsor ads from within Money, find the option setting to stop displaying all sponsors ads (by default, theyll show up).

All of the applications offer ease of use and great functionality.With OS X 10.2 I feel we are finally getting to the point where for the average user there will be no compelling reason to only think of Microsoft XP. OS X the and software that comes along with it or that you can buy does just about everything that average home user needs.If you are a Mac user I recommend this upgrade, if you are a Windows user thinking of changing...now is the time.", "unixReviewTime": "1031529600"}

Facing increasing pressure to get something out the door, and having gone through several failed attempts to unleash a modern operating system to replace the aging, original Macintosh operating system, Apple threw OS X (10.0) at dedicated Mac users as, essentially, a pay-to-play beta test.  Why, you might ask, would Mac users pay to play with a not-yet-ready for primetime OS?  I suppose you should ask Windows users the same question.  At lease Apple was kind enough to tell people that 10.0 was not for everyone and was going to be revised substantially.Then came 10.1 (now at version 10.1.5).  It improved the speed and features of 10.0 and made it ready for universal adoption.OS X 10.2 completes the cycle.  OS X has now been optimized.  Its fast, elegant, and groundbreaking.  It has been radically improved to work seamlessly with Windows computers and Windows networks.  It has built in, easy to use Bluetooth support.  Over all, it has about 150 additions and improvements.  There is no doubt that it is now the most sophisticated, stable, and appealling operating system out there.  With its UNIX core, it appeals to techies, too.A great OS just got greater.  Much greater.", "unixReviewTime": "1029369600"}

When you first install this software, it guides you through the process to set it up the way you want it.  You can easily reconfigure its many different features later if you change your mind.  NIS warns you when something is accessing the internet, an excellent feature especially if you are always connected with a broadband service.  It also alerts you if there is a potential attack on your computer and automatically blocks the attack.  If there is an attack on your computer, it gives you details about the type of attack and the ISP# where the attack originated so that you can follow up if necessary.Other features I like include ad blocking (you can block pop ups as well as many banner ads) and parental controls.  Also, you can tell Norton about important information you may keep on your computer, such as credit card numbers and account information, that you want Norton to protect and not allow to be sent out.  This comes with the antivirus software, also, so your computer is well protected.Also, you can set Norton to auto update your antivirus and internet security features so that you are always best protected or you can choose to do it manually.  The firewall is also easy to configure to your own liking.

For anyone who started their computinghobby or career with Nortons software and books, or CentralPoints software and hardware products, you know where Imgoing with this: Symantec ruins a good product.All right, ruins is a strong word, but let me illustratein this exact case.  WRQs AtGuard was a model of simplicity.It threw a popup box whenever it encountered an event it didnthave a rule to match.  Lets say incoming traffic fell throughall your rules: AtGuard asks What should I do?  Allow itall the time, just this once, block it once, or block it allthe time?  Four choice, covers the gamut.  In the cases ofads, thats enough.  In the cases of TCPIP or ICMP traffic,permanent choices also brings you right into a quick dialogof exactly what to block (port, address) and how to name it(blocking 427 incoming, blocking ms-sql-m traffic).For NIS, especially the NIS2k series, you dont have theseadvanced choices.  You also have a great deal of presetrules that arent always useful, because they err on the sideof blocking rather than permitting.  Good for newbies, notgood for pros.Another downside if youre experienced is that to get to ruleeditors and advanced options, you have to click through anenormous cascade of menus.  In AtGuard, its two clicks away.Thats just unacceptable: if the purpose is to keep newbiesout of the advanced menus, just add a password and unlockthe necessary menus.Finally, NIS2k does away with site-specific ad filtering.Inexplicably, you have to choose to block images from an entiredomain instead of a single machine.  For anyone who surfs Yahoo,you understand the value of allowing us.yimg.com andnot us.a1.yimg.com.In terms of how NIS2k works with systems, I stronglydeter individuals from using it.  It has a poor installationprocedure, it doesnt co-exist properly with enough software,and its a bit of a mess to uninstall.  NIS2k and Symantecsvirus scanner products are notorious sources of softwareconflicts in professional networks, and my professional andpersonal experiences bear this out.I cant recommend NIS2k3 to anyone who doesnt already use it and like; I wouldnt try to convert anyone who seems satisifed with their results.

I can speak only for myself (and, for the record, my operating system is Windows XP Home edition), but I made an exceedingly smooth transition from Norton AntiVirus 2002 and Norton Personal Firewall 2002 to Norton Internet Security 2003.  All of my established settings came over without a hitch, I am having no problem at all scanning incoming and outgoing email messages, and the firewall would definitely appear to be doing its job.  The AntiVirus program now has the added capability of scanning instant messages, which is a very big deal, in my opinion.  The Spam Alert function is not quite perfect at distinguishing between true spam and valid messages, but it is a feature of at least some utility, and I am happy to see Symantec trying to incorporate it into their already excellent software package.  The Privacy Control feature is not new, but it is certainly an important part of the deal, affording the user some protection from the accidental release of important personal and financial information across the Internet.  I cant comment on the Parental Control feature because I do not use it, but certainly this is something parents will find appealing.  Last and certainly not least, this software allows you to block a great number of those increasingly annoying pop-up ads proliferating online.If this is your first time using the firewall software, you will have to go through some important steps in order to configure your security system for your own needs, but the system walks you through this pretty well, meaning you dont need to be a computer expert to do it.  You will also have to specify any personal information (such as credit card numbers) you want to protect from accidental release via web forms and the like, but this is not hard to do.

Oh my this is going to be exciting!  I was looking forward to some beautiful nature scenery and I wasnt disappointed. Moon Lake and the general lay of the lands [cemetary, speakeasy, sprawling trees] captured my imagination immediately.  The story of Prohibition law-breaking and rum-running really caught my attentions and found myself absorbed in the newspaper clippings and the desire to find the gold bars. This plot line was one of the Top Ten stories HER had to offer us players thus far!INITIAL SCORE: 93CHARACTERS:Red Knott: This weird bird watcher that observes avian only at night gave me the creeps as I thought I caught sexual innuendos when I talked with him in that treehouse.  If I do this this for you, what are you going to do for me? [long pause] and Pretty girls should be okay out here [something along those lines].  I immediately went into stranger-danger mode and kept to the cabin when he was around. And he ALWAYS was!Emily Griffen: Her twangy voice was peculiar and I had her pegged as my # 1 suspect I think mostly because I felt force-fed information about the other two residents and didnt want to buy too much into these evidential setups.Jeff Akers: The park ranger with the big aspirations and familial ties to the mob had all the makings of a culprit served on a platter. He had motives to get the land back into public hands, rumors of hidden gold, etc.  I loved reading all the information in the ranger station which could be opposed by many of the young gamers who dont want to be educated like they were in school ha, ha.Vivian Burnett Whitmore: She has to be on my Top Ten list of ND characters based on how funny it was talking with her and the information she provided me [relationship with the gangster Mickey Malone, the four rottweilers] and the key she mailed over.Beth/George/Hardy Boys: Again, didnt care for the Hint System, but I know I always had a place to call for a good laugh [my girls!] Dialing the phone feature was VERY tedious!CUMUL SCORE: Even = 93SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:Based on how I used to enjoy the woods in my youth, the visuals was absolutely perfect; especially the moonlight sequences!  The speakeasy was lovely, but there really wasnt much to do except examine paintings and I was frankly disappointed. The thuggy jazzy score set up with stirring moody numbers brought my mind back to the roaring 20s.CUMUL SCORE: + 3 = 96PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES:  Now that I think about it, I dont think there were ANY mini-games. I know the puzzles revolved mostly on collecting items [bird pictures & critters] and staying focused on the makeup of the dogs colored collars and such.  Not  bad in any sense, but when you compare that to other ND games, those captured your attention more. In this game it was a slight let-down.CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 95ADVENTURE ENDING: I got to see the evidence into making the actual ghost dogs and loved the cuteness of these canines [although wanted to release them from their cage].  I guessed the culprit!!!! That makes my rating about 45%  All-in-all, I was pretty pleased.CUMUL SCORE: Even = 95* PART 2 *I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were totake weeks! Well, it took me two days [8 hours] and I gave myself aDetective Score Of : 82My Strong Points: I pushed through at a pretty rapid pace and never really got into any entanglements from puzzles or stuck in plot line devices. The water valve puzzle was solved with my screwdriver ingenuity and the tunnel navigation was nearly flawless.My Weak Points: I guess I missed it when Vivian said Waldos other name, because this puzzle kept me grounded in thought needlessly. I died on the rotten floorboards, ha, haOVERALL GAME SCORE: 94 + 82/ 2 = 88.5 [ B + ]BOTTOMLINE: I agree with other gamers that the ghost dogs were underutilized. The fact why I dont consider it a problem was that this wasnt a horror movie, this was an adventure.  I was quite occupied with the engaging storyline and not worried that I was going to by chased through the forests with my life at stake. Although missing the A grade HER so often does, it is one of their top adventures in the series thus far.Thus far, on my list of the 19 completed ND games, GHOST DOGS ranks.... # 1 !!!!!1) GHOST DOGS OF MOON LAKE * 88.52) THE SHATTERED MEDALLION  * 87.53) GHOST OF THORNTON HALL  * 874) HAUNTING CASTLE MALLOY  * 85.55) HAUNTED CAROUSEL  * 846) WHITE WOLF ICICLE CREEK  * 827) DANGER DECEPTION ISLAND  * 818) SHADOW AT WATERS EDGE  * 789) WARNINGS AT WAVERLY  * 77.510) THE CAPTIVE CURSE  * 7711) SECRET SHADOW RANCH  * 76.512) TRAIL OF THE TWISTER  * 7213) PHANTOM OF VENICE  * 71.514) TOMB OF THE LOST QUEEN  * 7115) THE SILENT SPY  * 70.516) ALIBI IN ASHES  * 7017) THE DEADLY DEVICE  * 69.518) SECRETS CAN KILL [REMAST] * 6919) CURSE BLACKMOOR MANOR * 68", "unixReviewTime": "1409443200"}

You have Emily, the southern store owner, Red, the anthropic bird watcher, and Ranger Akers, the strict runner of the town who loves ticketing people. None of them are very colorful, and definitely arent the highlight of this game.Puzzles/Exploring: 5.5/10. Theyre arent many puzzles in here as there are tasks, and one thing that forces me to knock down this games score is that exploration feels practically nonexistent. Theyre really isnt anything to search or sleuth in besides a frustratingly big forest and the occaisonal passage. But the few puzzles that were there I could usually do without hints, which means that they were really simple.Activities:5/10. Another thing that is pretty much nonexistent in this game. The only things that even come close to fun activities in this game are bird-watching and reading the lakes history on the Sheriffs computer. I would have like more plain fun to be added in this game.Ending:7.5/10. Some endings take a little bit of time to complete, and may even require a second chance, but this one is over very quickly, yet it somehow gives you that goosebumpy feeling that good Nancy Drew endings give you. Im sure you know what I meanTotal (average): 6.58 out of 10, averaged to....6.5/10.While there can still be some fun to be had with this game if youre a diehard fan like me, Id recommend that new Nancy Drew PC fans or someone looking for one of the games to buy, look at another HERInteractive title for now.", "unixReviewTime": "1313971200"}

Nearly every game before this one has held onto a classical quality of mystery, intrigue, and adventure. This wonderful 7th addition, Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake, is no exception at all.This game takes place shortly after the previous game. While interning at Beech Hill, Nancys friend Sally sent Nancy a letter asking for her help. Something frightening has been happening ever since shes moved into her new home in Moon Lake, Pennsylvania, and shes hoping that Nancy can find out what. Nancy naturally agrees to drive out, only to find out that Sallys been frightened away from her home. What exactly did this? The answer comes all too quickly when pack of four ghost hounds that attack the house while Nancys inside. Legend has it that they once belonged to Mickey Malone, the gangster who originally lived in the house, until their beloved owner passed away. Upon his death, the dogs ran off into the neighboring woods, and could be heard howling in the distance until they all died. They now return every time somebody tries to live in the old Malone home. Could these dogs be seeking their owner in the netherworld, or is a sinister criminal trying to scare Sally away from her property? And if its the latter case, why?The plot used in this game is truly a masterpiece. Ive yet to find another story like this one. This case is definitely another stepping stone in the realm of Nancy Drew gaming, offering a plot unlike any other, and giving a fresh, new feel to the series while doing so.  The house is very detailed, and I loved exploring the nearby woods. The graphics are very beautifully realistic, and made me feel as if I was right there with Nancy as she listened to the beautiful birds sing by day or wandered through the creepy woods at night.This game only has three suspects, which is a move never used before (all games before have had four, except for Stay Tuned for Danger with six). Some might not like this move, but I thought it was a pretty good one, because it left space for originality in the game. It also made it more realistic - really, if we were solving cases in real life, what would be the odds that wed ALWAYS have four suspects every time?The suspects include a retired antisocial bird watcher named Red Knott, who spends most of his time on his observation platform making odd noises to get birds out of hiding. Emily Griffin is another suspect in the game, and is the owner of a store called Ems Emporium, specializing in antiques from the 20s. The last suspect is Ranger Jeff Akers, the park ranger for Moon Lake who enjoys bossing people around. All of the characters had very solid motives to want Sally out of her house, but the most solid motives dont come to light until nearly halfway into the game. I wasnt really sure whod be the culprit in the end, but was rather happy with the culprit choice that was made.The other six games before this one all had excellent soundtracks. Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake is no exception. This game features a lot of music with a strong nature feel to it, and it was very peaceful to listen to while exploring the woods and around Moon Lakes community. At night, the music becomes slower and more eerie, and it was complimented by the sound of chirping crickets. The music played whenever Nancys in danger was as suspenseful as always, but also had a bit of that dark nature edge to it like the nighttime music did. Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake is yet another example of a game with a perfect soundtrack.Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake is another term for a great step in the Nancy Drew series. I cant complain about this game much at all, and everything within it is so rich and fresh. I love this game, and I cant wait to write about the next one! :)", "unixReviewTime": "1308960000"}

But, since I got it as a Christmas present, I gave it a try. And I will be the first to tell you that its NOT terrifying, and its actually pretty good! Im going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.PLOT - 5/5: Nancy goes to visit her friend Sally MacDonald at Moon Lake because Sally says some terrible things have been happening at her lakeside cabin. When Nancy gets there, though, Sally has left out of fear. So Nancy decides to stay and solve the mystery of the ghost dogs who show up at night and attack the cabin. I thought this was a really good plot. Unlike in some other ND titles, I really wanted to solve the mystery and find out where these dogs were coming from. And trust me, the dogs werent the least bit scary. The plot wasnt too short or too long. Another solid plot from Her Interactive!CHARACTERS - 4/5: There was a real lack of characters in this game. There were only 3 that you could actually see. I guess they did that so Moon Lake would really feel desolate, and it worked. The three main characters were Red Knott, an anti-social bird watcher, Emily Griffen, the store owner who has a fun accent, and Jeff Akers, the lone park ranger. Overall, the characters were OK. I kind of wish there was more, though.SETTING - 4/5: The setting was pretty good. I cant say it was beautiful or anything, because although it was well done, it was just kind of creepy looking. But there was lots to explore, including a whole forest maze that was really hard to get the hang of. There wasnt much to see inside the cabin, or around the lake, but the forest was pretty big so that made up for it.PUZZLES - 4/5: The puzzles were pretty easy in this game. I could figure most of them out without a walkthrough. The maze was probably one of the hardest puzzles, and I kept getting lost. But other than that they were all short and sweet.WAS IT CHALLENGEING?: Nope. I never got frusterated, I only died like once, and I barely used a walkthrough. 2/5ENDING - 5/5: The ending was actually good! I liked how they revealed who the culprit was, and catching them was very clever. Plus everything leading up to the ending was fun too.FINAL SCORE:Plot: 5Characters: 4Setting: 4Puzzles: 4Challenge: 2Ending: 5= 24, divided by 6 = 4 stars", "unixReviewTime": "1294012800"}

She wont tell you over the phone whats scaring her, though, and when you get to her house, shes gone!  You soon find out that dogs with glowing eyes have been attacking her house, and they have scared her away.  You can call her in the game, so dont think shes been kidnapped or something.Graphics-They were pretty good, and the dogs didnt look that bad.  The characters still need some work, and the backgrounds could be better, but overall, I love the graphics.Sound-The music has a slight country twist on it, and although I hate country music the music isnt that bad in the game.  The voice acting could have been better, but its not as bad as its been before.Gameplay-The car you drove up in is blocked by a tree that fell down right behind it, so you have to get around via motorboat, which you have to fix first.  Also, there are only 3 characters in the game, so it really gives you the feeling that this is definitely not the city anymore.  Point-and-click is the same.  So is calling Bess and George for hints.  There is a tad bit of history in this game but not as much as in the last game.  Thank goodness!  You have to choose day or night, however, and you dont have an alarm clock in this game.Fun-Yeah, this is a fun game, but as before mentioned in other reviews, the puzzles dont have much to do with the story, and they revolve a lot around Roman numerals.  The puzzles arent great, but the story really makes up for it.  Still, the story is not the least bit scary, but it is still a great story.Length-Not as long as the last one, playing this one through is about 10 hours, but of course, the first time you play it, it will be longer.  It does have a replay value, but the puzzles are rather dull that I just dont bother with this game that much.A great game with an excellent story but rather dull puzzles.  I definitely recommend buying it, though!", "unixReviewTime": "1260662400"}

Nancy jotts down important notes and such in it and this time, you dont have to scroll ALL THE WAY DOWN to look at the new stuff she wrote (unlike the previous Nancy Drew game). Its really scary in the beginning and in other sections too. You have to snoop around at night and go to the graveyard! Id say it is pretty freaky. But its loads of fun.

{"overall": 4.0, "reviewerID": "A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB", "asin": "B00006OAQU", "reviewText": "Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake is the seventh Nancy Drew game from Her Interactive. This time around Nancy is visiting family friend Sally McDonald at her new cabin in Ghost Lake, Pennsylvania, once home to notorious 1920s gangster Mickey Mallone. Sally has fled in fear, and when Nancy arrives she finds herself trapped at the cabin due to a fallen tree. Sally hurriedly calls her from her cell phone, warning her about the ghost dogs. Soon after, Nancy sees them for herself: four snarling, lunging Rottweilers with glowing teeth and eyes attack the cabin, rattling the doors and throwing themselves at the house.Nancy decides to stay and get to the bottom of her latest mystery: ghost dogs or flesh-and-blood ones? There are three suspects: Emily Griffen, owner of Ems Emporium (Moon Lakes general store), Jeff Akers, park ranger, and Red Knott, retired birdwatcher. All three have some direct connection to the reason behind the hauntings, and the main motive is the rumoured cache of stolen gold that Mickey Mallone stashed somewhere near the cabin before being hauled off to jail (where he died). Nancy must navigate through a maze of woods to find the cemetery behind the cabin in order to search for clues, as well as interrogating suspects, snooping through secret passageways, and escaping danger.As in all Nancy Drew games, Nancy can die in a number of ways if shes not careful. This time possible deaths include a motorboat explosion, falling through rotten floorboards, falling down a hole in the dark, being clubbed with a human bone, being tied up and left in a burning shed, and being drowned, so be careful and save often!GDoML features beautiful graphics of various locations to explore: Mallones cabin, the woods, several locations on Moon Lake, a cemetery, an underground network of passageways, and a speakeasy. Playing as a Senior Detective, I found that the difficulty level was just about right, however, the woods maze drove me crazy and I had to go online to print off a decent map (the one included in the game didnt help me much). That was by far the most challenging part of the game, since Nancy has to go into the woods a number of times to search for clues, birds, bugs and more. Every screenshot looked the same, and the map had to be brought up each time, with no way to mark Nancys progress onscreen.One nifty feature was Nancys PDA, which automatically records clues, phone numbers, and hints. You can also call Sally, a mystery woman connected to the case, and George and Bess if you need clues. Most of the puzzles were of two types: numeric/dials/switches or tasks. There are several dial puzzles, a letter block puzzle, a valve puzzle, and a safe combination to crack. The other three characters will assign Nancy tasks in return for necessary items such as batteries, camouflage gear, sandpaper and a spark plug, including stacking cola cans, finding bait in the woods, taking pictures of birds with a digital camera, and organizing file folders by Roman numerals. Nancy also performs tasks for Sally, such as testing the well water and repairing rotten floorboards. The puzzles in this game seem much more natural and integrated into the gaming environment than in some previous Nancy Drew games. As with previous Nancy Drew games, there is an alarm clock setting to change from day to night since some tasks (and events) can only be completed then.Graphics were above average and voice work and sounds were above average as well. The ambient nature sounds were very well done (the forest sounds different between day and night, insects droning, individual bird calls, creaking wooden doors and stairs, the ghost dogs). The music was not memorable other than building tension in certain key scenes. The interface is simple: all actions are accomplished with the left mouse button. You can pan around some screens, making it closer to 360 rather than a static environment, but overall the Nancy Drew games are still in a slideshow format. One improvement is characters: in earlier games characters would only have one or two movements and repeat them while talking to Nancy, and the lip-synching was really bad. In GDoML, at least one character moves very articulately and randomly and characters lip synch much more realistically. The attention to detail makes this game educational as well as fun: in the ranger station there is a computer with files on local wildlife, park regulations, and the history of Moon Lake. Nancy will do a good deal of reading old newspaper clippings and journals. Nearly everything is subtitled for hearing-impaired players (a very nice touch), including sounds, dialogue and cutscenes. One last feature that I appreciated was the short promos for the other six Nancy Drew games in the series and a trailer for the next Nancy Drew game The Haunted Carousel. Overall this is a nice introduction to the Nancy Drew series from Her Interactive and a fun mystery to solve with plenty of details and creepy moments. Good luck and happy sleuthing!", "unixReviewTime": "1053043200"}
{"overall": 4.0, "reviewerID": "A1P4RH7KMJ1SV2", "asin": "B00006OAQU", "reviewText": "I have been playing Nancy Drew games for over two years and Ive now played all seven.  Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake was not my favorite.  In fact, I feel that it could have been better in so many ways.  Dont get me wrong.  The Nancy Drew games series is great.  In each game, you, as Nancy Drew, gather clues, interview people, solve puzzles, explore secret passages, and find the culprits.  The games are engaging, fun, and even educational.  And theyre fun for both kids and adults alike.  The first game in the series, Secrets Can Kill, was well-intentioned but the character graphics (and the fact that you had to switch back and forth between two CDs) left much to be desired.  However, after Secrets, the games began to significantly improve.  You would think, then, that by the seventh game, the games would be stellar.  Not true.  I think they peaked at game three (Message in a Haunted Mansion) and four (Treasure in a Royal Tower).  Its almost as if, by game seven, the designers/creators have run out of ideas.  I dont mean for the plots -- I mean for puzzles, for characters wisecracks, that sort of thing.  Things that move the game along and make it fun.  Most every puzzle in Ghost Dogs was eerily similar to a puzzle weve seen in a previous Nancy Drew game, the only exception being the one you have to play when Nancy is in peril toward the middle of the game (this is not a spoiler; in just about every Nancy Drew game, Nancy is in peril about halfway through the game.)  That puzzle was fun.  But the others could have been better.  Also, in each Nancy Drew game there is some sort of educational element.  You learn things as you go along, from books, computers, newspaper articles, or signs.  But in this game, there was a HUGE amount of information on parks on one single computer.  Most of this information wasnt even important to the game.  Why is it there?  Whos going to sit there and read it?  With all due respect, I was just slightly bored with Ghost Dogs.  My last complaint (and I really dont mean to sound like a picky grouch; I love Nancy Drew, really, I do) is Nancys personal data assistant that she carries with her now.  She puts all her clues in there.  She even carries maps around with her now!  One of the most fun things about the Nancy Drew games, for me, has been that you have to write down clues (on paper, in real life), trace maps, etc.  If I happen to not notice a clue in Ghost Dogs, well hey, Nancy (but I thought *I* was Nancy?) has already jotted it down for me.  And this was on the senior level!  I guess I could just NOT look at the PDA, but come on, its too tempting.  Wheres the challenge?  I really hope the next game will be better; from the promo, it looks very intriguing.  And I *do* have faith in the designers to make this next one a winner.  In conclusion, me just say this: if youve never played a Nancy Drew game before, youd be safe to start with this one, since all the puzzle concepts would be new to you.  But its not the best.  Still, if youre a Nancy Drew fan, its still pretty amusing and so I give it 4 stars.", "unixReviewTime": "1043712000"}

In them, Nancy Drew, the college-aged female detective, explores mysteries and finds solutions to various puzzles.You can see the various improvements in this latest entry. The graphics are much smoother, and as you turn around in a given area the snapshot quality is more of a flow. Its still not a fully immersive environment - in essence you go to a spot and then can turn left or right through set images of the room. You can point to a hot spot in the room to approach an item or examine it. Still, in a way this makes it easier for younger detectives to know what to do. If you cant click on something, its not important.Theres no violence or blood, although I do have to comment that the ghost dogs are rather scary! I have had younger teenage girls refuse to play some of the games Ive lent them because they were too scary after a few hours. This one might fall into that category if you have a skittish nature. The dogs dont actually attack you, but their jumping on the doors, howling and rattling the house can be quite frightning.The game uses very logical puzzles that actually teach you things. You want to test water from a well, but first you have to learn the real technique for priming a pump and do it. You need to use a motorboat, but the pistons arent in the proper cycle positions. Anyone who uses a boat would see this by looking at the engine, and they helpfully include a diagram to show you (i.e. Nancy) how to fix this before the engine will work. Notes at the ranger station warn you about Hantavirus, a real danger if youre cleaning areas where mice live.There are other puzzles - identifying birds, finding planks to get over rotten floorboards and so on - that fit in as well. In general the game does an admirable job of keeping the game very realistic-feeling, like youre really at this Pennsylvanian lake, amongst the locals there, exploring their world.On the downside, much of the game involves pony-trail sorts of handoffs. You know you need a spark plug. You might think it would be lying around nearby or that one would be in the house. But instead, searching all over creation finds none. Instead, you have to go to sleep, wake up at night, chat with someone who it so happens has one, go back to sleep again, and then in the morning use it. It can get extremely frustrating when at many times in the game you know what you *need* but just have to figure out how the game designers think you should *get* it.Still, many times this means that your gameplay time is stretched out as you wander around, explore, chat with people, and enjoy the world. Its not a game for people who want to race through to the end to have beaten it. If you poke at a walkthrough site, you can probably do so in an hour or two. Instead, its a game that, for a relatively low price, lets you wander through a well realized world, exercise those little grey cells in your brain, and really become knowledgeable about a number of intersting subjects.

It also prompts you to make you remember about things that may have slipped you mind, like other deductions. And, it makes suggestions for deductions that you may not have thought about. At the end of the process you can print out the forms for mailing in the traditional format or in a format thats easy for the IRS computers to read. In addition, you can opt to file electronicly.

This is what computers have promised to deliver for some time now.  In this and other ways, Microsoft is finally bringing it to users in a usable, intuitive manner.Previous features such as spellchecking, grammar, integration and smart cut-copy-paste operations are all present.  Perhaps the best addition to the suite is Microsofts OneNote, which promises to capture freeform notes and text in whatever way you like, digitizing tablet handwriting or keyboard entry; the killer app is how it recognizes the handwriting and indexes the text for finding your notes again.

This is a release most-targeted for businesses that can afford to roll this out to many users under a favorable license.

I am disappointed with the default use of the current theme in Windows XP, but with the new tool bar icons, it makes you forget about that. Overall its a wonderful work experience with Office 2003. The suite offers improved reliability and stability, because of the integration with the supported operating systems. Once the suite is installed, you dont have to restart your computer, just start using the applications, the suite even has its own default programs group (finally), which keeps your programs menu less cluttered.Word 2003 includes development tools that add dynamic features to documents making them powerful than ever. The power beneath all this is XML, allowing the user to embed components for updating data in documents such as stock quotes.

But are still necessary for the average user because of the control over information across all the Office applications. Tools such as Information Rights Management (IRM), (this controls the flow of information to specific users), persons can be restricted on how they use your Office files; whether its printing or sharing, very powerful! Reading view is an enhanced mode of print preview; documents are laid out in virtual pages reducing the need to print. The Task Pane is also improved by offering resources to look up information on a particular topic being typed; this is a feature across the core Office applications. Lots of other great features make Word 2003 a worthy upgrade.Excel is a XML mammoth because of the integration with the language. The ability to migrate data between different storage sources and extraction of information to make it flexible in different scenarios. Tables can be transferred back and forth between applications such Word with ease. Excel can continually use the tables from documents as a data source for further expandability. Its the flexibility for data exchange that makes Excel 2003 very powerful.Outlook, is so revamped, this alone is a worthy upgrade. Three panes in Outlook 2003 make e-mail an enjoyable experience. The Mail Pane holds all of the necessary tools found in prior versions of Outlook such as the Outlook Bar, and the different folders such as inbox, calendar, etc. The second pane gives an expanded view of the different items listed in the Mail Pane, like your incoming mail, contacts and calendar, which makes reading these information resources easier on the eye and productive by providing a better view. Reading your e-mail in the third pane (Preview Pane), the user views the message in portrait layout, more content is seen compared to prior versions. Its even better to view e-mails with Clear Type turned on for Windows XP users. Other features such as improved Virus and Spam protection makes Outlook 2003 a great upgrade. Outlook is not placed on the desktop by default, it can also be minimized to the system tray in Windows, for users connected to an Exchange Server, this displays all the network settings available.PowerPoint 2003 offers the same features of version 2002, but what makes it an enticing upgrade is the package to CD feature that allows users to save presentations onto CD-ROMS. The PowerPoint Viewer included with each Package to CD allows it to be played on other computer systems even if PowerPoint is not installed. Windows media integration is also in PowerPoint 2003, which makes watching presentations more fun and exciting. The effects are fantastic when combined with these elements. The ability to integrate videos into Presentations to create home movies has long been a request of users, even if they have a DVD burner. For the PowerPoint 2000 user this is a worthy upgrade that provides simple yet Powerful tools to take presentation graphics to a new level.This new version of Access is also XML integrated, enhanced features such as extraction of data from multiple tables, Access 2003 also improves Smart Tag integration. The ability to design solutions within the program makes web services a powerful resource for the enterprise; the flawless integration with Microsoft SQL makes information sharing a productive experience. This makes data storing and retrieval an easy way to control how data is implemented across many scenarios using personalized solutions, allowing your information to have a stronger impact across the Enterprise.Publisher has become a mainstream Office application because of its integration with other Office programs. It connects to product databases; the Mail Merge feature is much improved because its the same one as Microsoft Word, which offers greater ease of use. The Start Center is awesome, which makes starting publications an organized experience for the user. The interface is less cluttered and more customizable.

Older MS Office 2000 was the last 5 star version, imo.  This version (2003) -- although superior to later versions -- did pick up a little bloat since 2000, and Help has largely become an online feature (not sure how much/to what extent), and that is mildly unfortunate.  Sad that MS _seems_ to be determined to somewhat ruin their flagship products in numerous ways (??) -- but very grateful their outstanding, earlier products can still be acquired and used, for a while anyway.So, although not quite as hot as Office 2000, this 2003 version is more current concerning file formats, and new features that are needed on occasion.  IE:  you dont want WORD to crash when you are pasting some content from a Web page, right?

The RESEARCH option is something to contend with and could be quite useful - it is almost like having Encarta loaded on your machine as well.

Again, it behaves just the same as previous versions of Outlook did.Microsoft chose to retire the Office bar and that is a big mistake.  They are trying to push the Quick Launch bar but most businesses and almost all Office users preferred the Office bar.Dont get me wrong:  Office 2003 works very well and with Word, Outlook, Excel, Access and Publisher you can literally do anything!  It also preforms very well.  But, again, unless Microsoft starts making major changes, these releases should not be heralded as new.

Theres much to like in this program; however, Ive installed the upgrade on two different machines (the Small Business version on a Dell Dimension 8200 desktop, and the Professional version on an IBM T40 Thinkpad); upon intallation IE6 immediately began generating run-time errors.  Ive been using IE since it was first introduced and never had experienced a single run-time error; now I get them constantly.  In checking the Microsoft support sites for both Office and IE, I found Im not alone in experiencing this phenomena.  Its extremely annoying, and the standard response from MS is: its probably due to spyware.  Well, Ive been running Spybot and AdAware for over a year, and my machines report no spyware (the Thinkpad is only a week old), but the problem persists (and didnt exist until I installed this upgrade).  I can only conclude that any spyware causing these problems must be embeded in the upgrade!So, beware of the potential for IE6 run-time errors if you install Office 2003.  Also, if you use Act! (or a similar program) that runs on top of Outlook, youll find that a supposed new security feature in Outlook requires you to manually permit Act to retrieve e-mail from Outlook every time new mail arrrives.

The website also had added automatically, without asking me, the download warranty that lets you download again for up to one year ($6.99) for both products.  I zeroed out the quantities for the three things I didnt want and went to the next page, where I expected to see only what I wanted, and a chance to confirm it before making the sale final.

I will complain to the credit card company and get my refunds, but all this run-around is another bad sign.  Is Norton in some kind of melt-down, that they have to treat customers this way?

You need to actually turn it off from the Norton Antivirus control panel and then go into the bin and delete items manually. This took me a few hours how to figure out properly but the documentation is online if you look for it.Although the package is slow - it is extremely solid, robust and finds those files that you need to remove. It may be a bulky added extra to your system but it will save your files some day and in this day and age you must have some protection (Try the FREE software packages out there like AVG and Ad-Aware to see what could be on your system!).Like I said I have never had any install/uninstall problems. It runs smoothly on Windows2000 and XP. It has never crashed on me. It finds the bad guys and kills them for me. It even finds files that the FREE software above can not.I would recommend it... maybe insist on using this software when you can. If you havent got it then get it.", "unixReviewTime": "1085184000"}

That is quite a responsibility. Since many computers come equipped with McAfee and various other antivirus programs. Some did not heed my advice and they went and downloaded the freeware antivirus utilities. This may be coincidence, but without fail every single one of those individuals (about 5 or 6 computers in all) ended up being knocked out of commission by viruses. On the computers that have had Norton on them, since 1999, I have not had one instance of a virus.I know that this experience isnt everybodys, and I know that no program can stop all viruses all the time, but so far Norton has a perfect record for me, so I will keep using it. Now that they have developed the Bloodhound feature to protect against new and unknown viruses, Im assuming that it will be even better.My one warning is that right out of the box, Live Update is not activated. I dont know why this is as many of my family who have installed it themselves do not manually activate it (since they didnt know they had to) and therefore operate with really old virus definitions until I go into the settings and turn LiveUpdate on.I have not hesitate to recommended Norton for every computer that my extended family has purchased. The never-ending rebates which often reduce the price of the software to almost nothing are great too. My recommendation is obvious: Norton is the best out there.", "unixReviewTime": "1084147200"}

{"overall": 5.0, "reviewerID": "A3QMJMTLJC34QC", "asin": "B0000C8XYI", "reviewText": "I have used Norton Antivirus since it infancy as a MS-DOS program.  I have stuck with the program because it works and works well, and with each new release it works even better.  For those who use Norton Antivirus 2003, there is little difference in the program, and perhaps the primary reason to move the newer version is the renewed subscription you will receive; the interface is the same.  Rather than radically changing the program from year to year, Symantec has made little improvements which enhance overall performance.  The results have been the consistency of a program that does the job of stopping viruses and does it well.Installation:Installation of Norton Antivirus 2004 is as straight forward as it is easy.  Barring any gaffes, the program will install and then ask you to register with Symantec which I recommend since this will setup the virus signature subscription program which lasts a year.Technical Note: A virus signature is a file which contains information the antivirus program needs to defeat viruses and clean infected files.  Without updated signature files the anti-virus program would soon become outdated.  Symantec, through Live Update, continually downloads new signature files to Norton Antivirus 2004 via a subscription service which is part of the program.  However, the service lasts only a year and must be renewed-for a fee of course.Users-like me-who also use Norton Internet Security 2003 (which shipped with Norton Antivirus 2003), will find that the program also interoperates with Norton Antivirus 2004.  During the installation process the older version will be removed and Norton Antivirus 2004 will be integrated with Internet Security 2003.As is the trend in software these days, Norton Antivirus 2004 will have to be activated either by the Internet or phone within 15 days of installation or it will stop working.Upon completion of the installation process Live Update will run and update the program with the latest program files and virus signatures.  Live Update will continue to run in the background (whenever you are on the Internet) in order to keep Norton Antivirus 2004 up to date.First Impressions:I am still impressed by this program.  As I stated above I have used Norton Antivirus for a number of years and I have grown to respect its functionality.  Symantec has fixed the once vexing problem that plagued earlier releases of Norton Antivirus, resource allocation, as the program had a tendency to consume more than its share.  This is no small issue since the program runs in the background.  However with the release of Norton Antivirus 2003, Symantec licked the resource issue, resulting in a much better functioning program.The sole purpose of an antivirus program is to protect your computer from viruses and this is where Norton Antivirus 2004 outshines the rest. Norton Antivirus 2004 protects your computer in the background in three primary ways:* Auto-Protect: protects your computer in the background by continuously monitoring system files for malicious code, including the boot sector, and memory.  Also checks files as they are downloaded from the Internet or from a floppy or other removable disk.  This option can be turn off.* Inbound & Outbound Email Scanning: as the title implies, Norton Antivirus 2004 integrates with your email program and automatically scans incoming and outgoing email, or can be set up to scan either.  In the case of outgoing mail a small box will pop up from the task bar indicating scan progress.  And incoming virus via an email will result in a popup box asking you what you want done with the offending code.  This option can be turn off.* Script Blocking: monitors script-based viruses like those encoded in emails of applets executed from the Internet, and alerts you to such behavior, stopping these viruses before they can infect your computer.  This option can be turn off.I utilize all three options because I spend a lot of time on the Internet and I continually receive email, both personal and professional.  Just today Norton Antivirus 2004 detected three viruses in spam sent to one of my email addresses.  To me, the program pays for itself the very first time it saves your computer from a malicious attack.Virus Scanning:Norton Antivirus 2004 can accomplish virus scanning manually or via scheduled events which you can control.  Manual scans can be accomplished at any time and the option exists to scan the following:* My Computer* Scan all removable drives* Scan all floppy disks* Scan drives* Scan folder* Scan filesCustom scan jobs can also setup and run immediately, or scheduled to run at a later time.  I have setup the program to scan my network drives every Saturday night at 2:00 A.M. and my computer at the same time on Sunday, thereby freeing me from worrying about doing a complete scan on a regular basis.  Norton Antivirus 2004 does it for me!Conclusion:Virus protection has gone from a nice-to-have utility to a necessity that every computer connected to the Internet, or a network (work or home), or used jointly, cannot do without.  For me Norton Antivirus 2004 is the best anti-virus program on the market, and I highly recommend it.", "unixReviewTime": "1069027200"}

This time around Nancy is visiting marine biologist Katie Firestone at her friends request, but things go wrong as usual. Shortly after Ms. Drews arrival at to the San Juan Islands, Katie discovers that her whale watching boat has been vandalized. While Katie makes everything shipshape, Nancy is hot on the trail of the vandals, along with investigating recent burglaries, digging up Snake Horse Harbors past and making friends with a local legend.Besides Katie, Nancy meets Holt Scotto, fisherman and harbormaster candidate, Jenna Deblin, owner of the Hot Kettle Caf, and Andy Jason, who runs a rival whale watching business and wants to buy Katie out. Add to that strange fish that have been washing up on shore, a string of burglaries, and an eccentric widow who launches messages in bottles into the harbour. Danger on Deception Island is the most organic and satisfying of the nine current Nancy Drew games from Her Interactive. Several new additions include bicycling (similar to the motorboat interface used in Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake) and kayaking, WWW access from Nancys trusty laptop and more. The puzzles were excellently integrated into the gaming environment, making use of the Pacific Northwests charms: building sand castles, kayaking sea caves, bicycling the winding coastal roads, exploring a lighthouse, and digging for clams on deserted beaches. Nancy must also help Katie restore her boat to working order. There are several fun activities not necessary to win the game, including fixing sandwiches with some not-so-tasty ingredients (jellyfish, Tabasco sauce, expired mayonnaise, baking soda), building sand castles, and educational games about whales.As usual, there are two levels of difficulty, Junior and Senior Detective, and there are plenty of hints and help scattered along the way for both levels, including calling the Hardy Boys for tips and clues. There are many educational elements in Deception Island, including informative webpages about nautical terms, wood identification, Morse code, various types of whales and more that are necessary to solve the mysteries. Graphics are gorgeous (including photo overlays during the biking scenes), character modeling is lifelike, music includes rousing sea chanteys and ominous strings reminiscent of Jaws, and voice acting is above average. Sound effects make you feel like youre really standing on a lonely, windswept shore with only the breaking waves and cries of the gulls to keep you company. And you get to interact with a killer whale as well! Keep up the good work, Her Interactive! (Nancys next mystery is Secret of Shadow Ranch.)", "unixReviewTime": "1067385600"}

Well, you know that never works out especially when Katie is involved with controversy concerning a lone Orca that made its way onto the coast.  The whale isnt leaving and Katis boat is sabotaged. Many reasons crop up? Was it because she wont sell out to a local tour company? Is it because she is intimately involved in whale correspondence?  Hmmmm.....[as ND would say].INITIAL SCORE: 87CHARACTERS:Katie Firestone: She is involved in repairing her engine the WHOLE adventure! I really dont have confidence she knew what she was doing in regards to mechanical repair.  But, I guess she had nobody she trusted and it seemed it all happened in 24 hours [which is weird]. I didnt expect her to be the culprit at any point.Holt Scotto: For someone running for a political position such as Harbormaster, he can get pretty mouthy.  Its probably the sailor in him [ya know, you can never take the sailor out of the man....:) ].  I loved his personal quiz. Using the internet wasnt such a problem, but I was a little surprised on how much the game made me rely on it.  Id have liked it if HER could have included a couple more local characters that provided that information through their life experiences. I know that HER doesnt flesh out its character list with bodies that dont interact with Nancy directly, but it was also strange to hear the hustle and bustle of the Hot Kettle Cafe patronage when the place was vacant the entire adventure!Andy Jason: This guy gave me the chills.  He seemed a tool; was that it? Was it the  Whale Rules! anthem he irritated me by? I dont know, but I had him as my # 1 culprit because the other characters just didnt fit the profile.Jenna Deblin: She really thought a lot about herself, but she knew how to cook! I had a chance to eat her muffins, but was never given another chance at them after the initial offering! I thought that was quite odd.Hilda Swenson: This was a major character that ND never had the benefit of seeing. I dont remember another situation like that throughout the games I have played that avoided direct contact. I guess I was okay  with that.CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 86SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:The moodiness of the Pacific Northwest coastline was captured perfectly with fog and drabness.  The sounds of the sea [water splashing] and beach was above par.  The music had you captured in the moment when you were on a small mission and knew when to be subtle when you entered a building.CUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 88PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: The chess game I got from Holts book was awesome and right up my alley because I am pretty proficient.  I already knew about poker scoring and the plaque punch to earn a royal flush was just okay. The coordinates challenge really bothered a lot of reviewers, but I was fine with that whole system. In general, there was nothing that captured my fancy.CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 87ADVENTURE ENDING:  The new scenario aboard the ship was quite interesting although I wished I could have explored more aboard the deck.  I was happy to interact with the orca whale, but I always have the nervousness in the back of my mind what they can do to humans if they are angered.CUMUL SCORE: Even = 87* PART 2 *I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were totake weeks! Well, it took me three days [10 hours] and I gave myself aDetective Score Of : 75My Strong Points: I guessed the culprit immediately and I didnt waver off my initial thoughts.  I really didnt need a walkthrough for most of the adventure and I navigated well through the bays waters via kayak.My Weak Points: A couple puzzles were greatly confusing [sea cave snake puzzle & the wood identification]. I thought I was doing a good job with the descriptions and apparently I wasnt!OVERALL GAME SCORE: 87 + 75/ 2 = 81 [ B - ]BOTTOMLINE: I felt my enjoyment level was suppressed the entire game. Was it the gloomy atmosphere, was it the uninviting characters? I know that I wanted to solve the mystery, but there was no hold over me where i felt enthusiastic. This is a solid game entry in the franchise, but if you want thrills, perhaps you should keep this game on the back burner for now.Thus far, on my list of the 18 completed ND games, DECEPTION ranks.... # 7 !!!!!1) THE SHATTERED MEDALLION  * 88.52) GHOST DOGS OF MOON LAKE * 883) GHOST OF THORNTON HALL  * 874) HAUNTING CASTLE MALLOY  * 85.55) HAUNTED CAROUSEL  * 84.56) WHITE WOLF ICICLE CREEK  * 81.57) DANGER DECEPTION ISLAND  * 818) SHADOW AT WATERS EDGE  * 77.59) THE CAPTIVE CURSE  * 7710) SECRET SHADOW RANCH  * 76.511) TRAIL OF THE TWISTER  * 7212) PHANTOM OF VENICE  * 71.513) TOMB OF THE LOST QUEEN  * 7114) ALIBI IN ASHES  * 70.515) SECRETS CAN KILL [REMAST] * 7016) THE SILENT SPY  * 69.517) THE DEADLY DEVICE  * 6918) CURSE BLACKMOOR MANOR  * 67", "unixReviewTime": "1410134400"}

I think what I disliked is that there is a lot (and I mean a lot) of running around and learning. Which also happened in Secret of the Scarlet Hand, though it was handled better there. So what makes me like it now? Well, its the most straight forward game (aside from the later games that would literally hand you a letter or a diary that told you exactly how to play the game -- and for not having those, I appreciate this game all the more, since is shows you can have that sort of story and NOT tell the player of a MYSTERY game exactly what they need to do to reach the ending). And really, the learning isnt all that bad.I appreciate the characters more now, and the ending. I love the ending. Also, after looking at several other games, Ive come to love how everything works together. All of the puzzles help you in some way.However, I wouldnt recommend this game to new-comers to the series, or to the impatient fans. It isnt the most exciting game, so if youre looking for a game to get into the series with Id point you more towards Treasure in a Royal Tower or Secret of Shadow Ranch.

While I might be the one of the rare guys that play Nancy Drew instead of something like Call of Duty, everyone should give these games a chances, especially this one.Being a relatively old nancy drew game, some may consider it unfair to compare this game to newer ones. But, this game can go toe to toe with some newer nancy drew games and beat them. Heres why:Story: 8/10. Definitely not the most interesting storyline of the series by a long shot, but the orcas situation of having people fight over what to do with it was surprisingly intriguing to follow. By the end, I was dying to know its fate.Graphics: 7.5/10. For a relatively early nancy drew game, the graphics are great for that time period. They obviously cant really hold a candle to the new games (Ransom of the Seven Ships is coastal too and is GORGEOUS). The game looks a bit grey and dull by the boat, but thats probably what HERInteractive was aiming for. Interiors like the diner and Whale World look great.Characters: 8/10. The characters were pretty tame in this game, but were distinct in themselves. You have the normal number of suspects (3-5) that each have their own personalities without going over the top. None of them are afraid to voice their opinions on what should be done about the orca, which to me was nice to see.Puzzles: 8.5/10. Some left me clueless, and I had to use walkthroughs from time to time, but they were puzzles that werent too easy, and werent too difficult either. Some games in the series have less puzzles and more chores and jobs. Fortunately, thats not this game.Activities: 8.5/10. Whale World was a great part of the game, and actually educated me about the ocean, which I didnt even realize until after I was finished with the game. The diner was somewhat charming, and the orca at the end was adorable.Ending: 9/10. Some games end with a large chase with the culprit, but in this one its a lot of sleuthing and catching the culprit is really satisfying. No more about it though, Id hate to ruin it.Total (averaged): 8.25 out of 10, rounded to....8/10.I highly recommend this game if you dont already have it, its probably my second favorite one in the series (behind Secrets of the Old Clock.).", "unixReviewTime": "1313798400"}

Theyre so easy to get immersed in, with hours of fun and detective work being spent playing them. Danger on Deception Island continues this great series on a wonderful route, and continues to be one of the best Nancy Drew games released to this date.Nancys friends Bess and George have arranged a vacation for her. Nancy will be staying with Katie Firestone, a marine biologist friend of Georges, in Snake Horse Harbor, Deception Island (one of the San Juan Islands off the cost of Washington state). Nancy is immediately greeted by Katie, who was just getting back to her houseboat from getting groceries. When the two make it back to the boat, they discover that its been ransacked and vandalized. Could this be the latest work done by an unknown group thats been robbing shops around town? Not only that, but an orphaned killer whale has recently made home in the harbor surrounding the town, and seems to be hanging around all by itself for no apparent reason.  Just who did this to Katie? Who are these vandals and robbers? And whats the real deal with this orca? Its now up to Nancy to submerge herself into the dangers surrounding Snake Horse Harbor to find the truth...Danger on Deception Island employs amazing graphics. Even though this game is a bit older, several of the graphics in this game could rival those used in games today. The suspects look so realistic that they almost look like actual actors and actresses. The graphics seen while kayaking, exploring the town, and walking on the beaches are nothing short of beautiful. Some real (or at least, realistic) photos of sea life are also presented throughout game play, which is a definite bonus. I felt like I was actually walking through a town by the beach while playing this game, instead of just playing a game featuring one.Danger on Deception Island has some of the best mini games, puzzles, and challenges that had been seen in Nancy Drew games upon its release. I especially enjoyed the mini games in Whale World (one of the explorable areas in the game). However, are several ways to die multiple times in this game (which doesnt bother me, but does some others), and one of the puzzles that involves getting a set of coordinates is very challenging and time-consuming. Aside from that puzzle, I cant complain at all.All of the characters had their quirks, but they were a pretty well-casted bunch. Every suspect fit the story rather nicely, and they all had moments when they looked like they could be the culprit. The culprit becomes rather shocking, as there are several clues that come up and point toward another character(s) at the end of the game, until the ultimate truth is revealed. I could hardly wrap my mind around the fact that this character was the guilty party, but it was definitely a very tasteful twist (though I still wouldve slightly preferred the culprit being somebody else).The first suspect met is Katie Firestone, whos a friend of Georges and a marine biologist. Shes pretty strong-willed, and definitely has some secrets that shes hiding from Nancy. Holt Scotto is an elderly fisherman whos running for harbor master, and doesnt particularly like Katies defense of a policy that forces boats to stay several feet away from the whale (as he has to take the long way to get out to sea). Jenna Deblin is the owner of the Hot Kettle Caf, and thinks Katie has a lot of secrets as to what she truly wants to do with the whale (i.e. study it instead of help it). Andy Jason is the owner of Whale World, a tourist attraction that specializes in educating visitors in facts about whales, and wants Katie to sell out to him.What really made the characters awesome was dialogue shared between Nancy and her phone friends. The conversations had with Bess and George and Frank and Joe Hardy were all very nicely scripted. Not a single one ever felt boring. The one-time phone friends were pretty memorable in their own ways too, such as Casey Porterfield (who constantly has a hard time understanding Nancy) and Hilda Swenson (shes so... well, Ill let you find out for yourself). The phone friends in this game were much better than the phone friends in several games were, and I would definitely like to see some of the one-timers make a second appearance.The musical score in this game was awesome, which could be said about every single game created before it. However, this game does have a bit more going for it musically, as it definitely goes out of its way to make itself unique. The game features a lot of songs that sounded like they belonged in a movie about sailors, or from a kids special to educate children about the seas and those who travel them. I felt like it went out of its way to make itself more beachy than other soundtracks have to make themselves scarier or more royal. The realistic sounds of waves, seagulls, and seals made the music all the more fitting.So, is Danger on Deception Island the best Nancy Drew game ever? Id say it ranks among them. There are very few complains that I can make about this game, as nearly everything about it goes above and beyond. I would love to see Nancy re-visit Deception Island in a future case, as well as meet several of the characters she met here again. The game is *THAT* good!", "unixReviewTime": "1309132800"}

Its definitely one of my new favorites! Im going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.PLOT - 5/5: Nancy is invited to Snake Horse Harbor to go whale watching with Katie Firestone. But when Nancy gets there, she discovers Katies boat has been vandalized. Somebody in Snake Horse Harbor is up to something illegal, and its up to Nancy to figure who it is! I thought that the plot was excellent. It was really intriguing and had lots of twists and turns and really kept me on the edge of my seat. The plot was so unique and fun, its a perfect example of just how awesome Nancy Drew games can be!CHARACTERS - 5/5: There was a good amount of characters in this game, and they all had incriminating evidence against them, so it was practically impossible to guess who the culprit was! There was Katie Firestone, a marine biologist whos nice, but virtually everyone in town hates her. Then theres Holt Scotto, and old school fisherman whos running for political office as Harbormaster. Jenna Dublin, who runs the local cafe and especially hates Katie. Then theres Andy Jason, who owns a whale museum and rivals Katies whale watching tours. I think Andy was my favorite person to talk to because it was hilarious every time he said And remember...WHALES RULE! And, of course, there was the orca herself, who was very cute!SETTING - 5/5: The setting was really well done. Ive been to Washington State, and this game captured exactly what the beaches look like there. It was foggy, but very beautiful. Plus, the cafe was friendly feeling and the stained glass was really pretty. The whale museum looked just like a real museum. Everything in this game was so realistic. And the music was really cheerful and nice, and it never got annoying or repetitive, which was great.PUZZLES - 5/5: The puzzles in this game were also wonderful. There was just enough so that you didnt feel like you were doing a puzzle every second, but you still always had something to do. Plus the puzzles were challenging, not so much that you get frustrated and want to quit, but just enough so that theyre exciting and fun. Thats another thing, the puzzles in this game were actually FUN, and as much as I enjoy this series, I cant say that a lot of the puzzles in the other games are fun. Theyre challenging, but not very much fun. But I can honestly say that I had a blast playing this game!IS IT CHALLENGING?: Yeah, its just the right amount of challenge. It was hard, but not so hard that I got frustrated or tired of it. It was really just perfect, Id give it a 4.5.ENDING - 5/5: The ending was so exciting. Snooping around, I really felt like I was in danger of being caught. Plus there was a big twist at the end in terms of revealing the culprit. I was surprised how scary the culprit got at the end, they just looked so evil! Catching them was fun, it took me a while to figure it out, but once I did I was very pleased. It was a fantastic ending to a fantastic game!FINAL SCORE:Plot: 5Characters: 5Setting: 5Puzzles: 5Challenge: 4.5Ending: 5= 29.5 divided by 6 = 4.9 rounded to 5", "unixReviewTime": "1285372800"}

However, this what I thought of it.Story-Bess and George have arranged for you to vacation with one of Georges friends, in a place called Snake Horse Harbor.  She owns a whale watching tour business, and when you arrive you find out that someone has vandalized her boat.  She sets to work repairing it as you question suspects to find out that a whale recently spotted in the water might be what has driven someone to wrecking Katies boat.Graphics-In this game, they were a little hazy, but that works perfectly with the story, as the island you are on is foggy year round.  The characters were pretty much the same as the last game.Sound-The music is not that upbeat.  Its rather lazy music.  Pretty much makes you think you can just take your time with this mystery.  And you can.  Although you can die, its usually from stupidity on your part and not because someone attacked you or something.Gameplay-The third person point-and-click hasnt changed, and neither has your cell phone.  As in the last game you have your cell phone to call people whenever you have a signal.  But sometimes you dont have a signal which is realistic but annoying.  The puzzles in this game are kind of hard, and they require patience and logic.  This makes the game last a little bit longer.  As in the title, I DID NOT like all the coordinations that you have to find in this game.  You have a GPS, and it seems every challenge is to find a new coordinate.  Not fun.Fun-Other than that, the games puzzles are really quite fun in spite of their difficulty.  The mystery is fun, too, as everyone has a motive to have vandalized Katies boat.Length-The game lasted me a few weeks, but I think playing it straight through takes about 10 hours.This is a near perfect game, but because of just a few flaws I have to take a star away.  Dont let that discourage you from getting it, though.  This is a must have for fans of the series!", "unixReviewTime": "1260748800"}

Pleased with so fine a product, I bought many over the years.  Certainly OS X (Panther) has thrown a couple gigabytes of ice water on that romance.  But Panther has made one thing clear that never was before.  Previously I never could quite express what I enjoyed about the older Mac operating systems.  I can now.  Before, I could find things.  And I always knew where I was in the hierarchy of folders.  If I had a document in a folder, stored in a second folder that ordering was always transparent.  I could see the folders open, one inside the other.  And when I closed up, they slipped inside one another quite intuitively.  No more.  In OS X, I havent a clue.  I do have a 750-page manual that I keep in my lap when working in Panther.  With a trembling finger on the step-by-step instructions and my other hand on the mouse, I can empty the trash successfully.  I know the red buttons close something-sometimes something I wanted closed, but more often my home window.  (Which Ive learned to find after a brief but infuriating search.)  There are candy colored yellow and green buttons too though I cant say what they do just now.  Its all there somewhere in the manual, but before reaching for help try a little reason.  If the red pill closes a window, what would logic suggest about the functions of the yellow and green?  Dont bother; logic is no guide in Panther.  And that encapsulates the problem.  In OS X nothing makes much sense, intuition is of no value, everything must be memorized.  The claim is that OS X is bedrock stable.  Try to console yourself with that tradeoff the next time you face the spinning beach ball of death.  Hint: Erase your hard-drive and re-install everything.  A rock after all is a rock.And dont get me started on the Dock.  Ive read (several times) the twenty-page introduction that explains just how easy the Dock is to use.  I condensed all that to a half page of notes, which Ive misplaced.  But the little icons do look nifty.  And they do bounce happily-like little corpses on deliberators.  In fact OS X has all the chrome gleam and high-tech awe of a modern hospital.  Yes it is wonderful how technology can keep a body alive on antibiotics, feeding tubes, and assisted breathing.

Even administrator tasks can be handled with ease. There are an abundance of setup utilities (wizards) and familiar system preferences (like control panels.)The Macintosh has always meant simplicity, ease of use, powerful utility and just plain fun. Panther continues the tradition and enhances the experience.Should you upgrade? Panther works for all G4 & G5 based Macs and MANY G3 systems. (PowerBook G3 Wallstreet and original PowerBook G3, G3 Beige and some other G3 systems are excluded from the supported systems list.) Essentially any G3 or higher Mac with built-in USB is supposedly supported. Panther has proven to be extremely stable. If you have a G5, Panther is almost essential to keep you up-to-date with all the hardware features and fixes becoming available.If you have a G4, you PROBABLY want to get the upgrade to be sure to get the latest enhancements and fixes. Many of the graphical improvements require high-end graphic cards to see the benefit, though.If you have a G3, first check to be sure your system is supported. Go to the Apple.com web page and select the Mac OS X tab. Then click on the Upgrade tab then select the link for Check the system requirements. If your system passes muster, you may want to consider Panther because of the latest updates. You probably wont notice too many speed improvements or enhanced graphics capabilities. However, since it is a stable upgrade and has a number of useful new features it is worth considering.If you have Internet access, getting updates is as simple as launching Software Updates from the Apple menu. There are many new features, outlined in the Amazon review and detailed at the Apple web site, Mac OS X tab, New Features tab.For me, my favorite new features are Expos and Fast User Switching. With Expos, hit one function key and all your open windows slide aside so you can see your desktop. Hit a different key and all windows are visble, in miniature and aligned. Click on one of them and it pops to the top of the heap.Fast user switching allows two (or more) separate users to use the same Mac at the same time. Each gets his/her own desktop and preferences. Select a user name from a new users menu at the top, right of the menu bar and enter that users password and poof, your desktop becomes the other users desktop. One user can log out and the other user can keep going. This is a real boon because both my wife and I are Mac addicts and still need to share one Mac (after all, isnt sharing what marriage is about?)Overall, I feel Panther is a worthwhile upgrade, but the price may be prohibitive to some.", "unixReviewTime": "1078272000"}

Running 10.3 on an Apple Macintosh G5 1.8GHz, we noticed a huge speed boost to almost every finder-level task. Opening windows, scrolling large directories, accessing other machines over the network, you name it, it seemed faster. But lets take a look at some of the unique features in Panther.Expos&eacute;. This is a very, very cool new feature that I am simply in love with. What does it do? Well, for the uninitiated, it gives you instant access to any open window from any program, including the finder. What Expos&eacute; does is makes every open window shrink on your screen, and you simply click the window you want to spring to the front. So whats the big deal, you ask? Unlike the old Application window in Mac OS 9, which will only show you the applications running, this shows you all your open windows. So if you have three Safari windows open (I never do, I am in love with Tabs now) this will let you see every window. Whats more, when you put your cursor over the mini-windows, the name of the window is displayed. You really have to experience Expos&eacute; live to appreciate just how much it is going to change the way you use the Mac OS. The only drawback for me is that it does not show any windows you may have minimized to the dock.To access Expos&eacute;, you first set it up in your system preferences pane. For myself, I have Expos&eacute; activate for all windows if I put my cursor in the upper-right hand of my screen. If I put my cursor in the lower right, only the front application (including the Finder) will show. By default, three F-Keys are also set to do the same. Even cooler, when you click F11, all open windows move out of the way to reveal the desktop, and stay out of the way until you call them back.If you have a multi-button mouse, you can also assign mouse buttons to do the same. I personally use my extra mouse buttons to launch applications, but I could set it up so that the scroll wheel button moves everything out of the way for quick access to the desktop.Expos&eacute; is one of those application that, like I said, better experienced than explained. I cannot get over how useful this is to how I would with my Mac. If it were not part of the OS, I would call this the next Killer App for the Mac.Heads-up Application Switcher. This is yet another way to switch between applications without using Expos&eacute; or the Dock. Mac OS 9 also had it. All you do is hold down the command-tab keys to bring up a heads-up display of the open applications. You continue to hold down the command (Apple) key while you Tab to the application you want. I used the same method in Mac OS 9 for years, and fell in love with it. It is one of the most missed features for me in Mac OS X.Welcome Back Labels! Yes, you can, finally, use labels in Mac OS X. But this, my friends, is labels on steroids! Labels work in all three views, Icons, List, or Columns. In Icon view, the label is a rich full color, rounded around the text. The icon itself is not colored, as it was is Mac OS 9. In List view, the color again does not apply to the icon, but to the entire line of the item labeled, so that the rounded colored bar extends across the entire windows. The same is true for Column view, but when you have clicked the labeled folder, the triangle keeps the label color. These may seem like not such a big deal, but they really are. Many, many people used labels to help find items, or to mark items that are of special importance, and it is a much-welcomed re-introduction to the Mac OS. Like Expos&eacute;, you really have to see the new labels in action to appreciate them.Many people are all up in arms about the brushed metal look, which is used in all the iLife applications, now being carried throughout the finder as well. These worries are unfounded, in my opinion. While I actually like the look, you can toggle it off if you wish. You do, however, loose some of the new functionality of finder windows if you do. Rather than having application folders, favorite folders, document folder etc&Eacute; at the top of each window, they are all now on the far left of your open windows. And they are all customizable. Personally, I think the new windows in Panther are a welcome improvement over the previous OS X windows.One neat, though small, new feature is Apple put the often-used Software Update in the Apple menu. Clicking this simply opens the Software Update pane, but it does save one step in the process. A small update, sure, but one I have already gotten used to. And as the Apple menu is unchanged system-wide, you are always one click away from it.Fast Switching. What is this? Well, if you share your computer with others, you will probably want to have multiple users accounts set up. A staple since the first release of Mac OS X, it was easy to switch to a different user. Now, however, it is even faster. When you activate Enable Fast User Switching in the Accounts pane in System Preferences, it puts the current users name in the upper right hand corner of your screen. It also puts in all the other names of any other user of your Mac. In my case, I have a Basic in which the system is basically as it would be fresh from the store. I also have one for my wife (even though she uses her own iMac, not my G5) and one named Kids which is for, obviously, my kids. (All they can do is create pictures in Illustrator or Photoshop, type up letters, and use Safari with bookmarks my wife and I approve, all others all deleted.)So what happens when you click one of those names? You entire screen rotates; bring that user to the front. If the name is password protected, in brings up the log-on screen. And best of all, you can leave your account just as it is, with all the applications running, and switch users. When you switch back, everything is just as you left it. This is amazing technology I dont think enough people utilize.All in all, Panther is a great OS. Of course, there will be some applications that will not run correctly and need updating, but that is true for any major OS upgrade. I am very, very pleased with Mac OS X 10.3, and think that for those with a newer machine, you will appreciate the added speed benefits and stability. The new features all work really well, and I look forward to delving deeper into Panther in the coming months.Tim Robertson", "unixReviewTime": "1070064000"}

The unique office-friendly design with integrated mounting and cable management are stand-out differentiators. This smart-switch has management capability appropriate for a office environment switch with power-saving electronics.Design:One of the first things that stands out on the ProSAFE Click switches is the form factor. The sleek dimensions clearly have the modular office environment in mind and can mount at many places in modular non-modular office environments.The click mounting system makes mounting a snap - literally. The locking tab make secure mounting of the Click Switch to the base in any of 2 orientations.The 8 port version has a sturdy plastic case in a silent fanless design. The 16 port model is also fanless, but has a durable metal case.The 8 port model provides 2 convenient USB charging ports suitable for tablets and other high-charge USB applications.  The power budget is 15W for both and any one port limited to 10W. This makes it handy in offices and conference rooms making it convenient for tablets or phones to get a charge boost. I like this in my home office because it eliminates 2 power bricks from my power strip.The interesting power connection can be plugged in to have the cable exit either in the same direction and the network cables or at 90 degrees to that out the long dimension. There is no power brick to clog up power strips - the power adapter is internal to the switch. Something I find a very desirable feature.The included Velcro cables tie completes the picture of switch design by someone who was thinking about usability in the real world as much as moving bits and bytes.Configuration:I downloaded and installed the ProSafe Plus Configuration Utility from the Netgear support site. The configuration utility found the switch automagically making it super easy perform initial setup on the Click Switch. The intuitive process was easy and there are only a couple of things to setup unless you need advanced features. Set the IP address - I recommend setting either a static IP address or a DHCP reserved address (what I did in my firewall) so the switch will always be at the same IP address. Change the password - The default password is password, so change it to something better!The Click Switch also has a web based management interface that is very usable if you prefer that instead of the configuration utility. I do.The advanced (and just nice) configurable features include: The port LEDs can be turned off so they are not distracting (Just nice and good for bedrooms too!) IEEE 802.1Q-or port-based VLANs are supported for segregated traffic (i.e. voip/data) Extensive QoS by WRR, strict priority, or both, Port-based QoS, IEEE 801.2p QoS, ToS QoS and DSCP based QoS. These are to help make sure time sensitive traffic gets priority (i.e. voip or video). Port by port Rate limiting Port by port link speed and flow control settings (including a disable setting to turn a port off if desired) Port by port Broadcast Filtering Port by port cable testing (good for a quick cable integrity check) Multicast control via IGMP snooping Port mirroring which connects two ports like a old school hub (good for troubleshooting or some monitoring)Note: the 8 port model has no LAG (Link Aggregation Groups aka Trunking). The 16 port model has up to 2 LAG group which can be nice for devices with 2 LAN ports that support static LAG. NAS devices come to mind.Most users will not need to mess with most of the advanced features.Green Power Use:The 8 port Click Switch uses a max of 20.1W of power including 15W of USB charging occurring at the same time. This means without someone charging their device power maxes out about 5W. With smart port power management most of the time power consumption should be less. Perhaps much less. This is less power than used to be common for unmanaged or dumb switches. The savings can add up if you have a bunch of these in your business.Support:I did not need to contact support with the 8 port Click switch, but while testing my 16 port model I did and got excellent support. Be sure to register your Click switch within 30 days of purchase and youll get  a lifetime warranty for a little extra peace of mind.Conclusions:The Netgear ProSAFE 8-Port Gigabit Click Switch has game-changing office oriented design and usability in a silent package. It is a capable smart switch which has good management and important features. The advanced features can make it possible to reliably integrate time sensitive traffic in the same switch as NAS file sharing, isolate traffic via VLAN support and more.The switch is wire-speed which means it can move traffic as fast as it can be pushed over the individual LAN cables. In my testing this is the case as with pretty much any modern smart and many dumb switches. Getting data through a switch has become pretty much a given these days.I had moved away from Netgear switches in recent years. Other manufacturers had more attractive solutions for my clients needs. Not so with the Click Switch. Because Netgear has built a compelling product for office (and many other) environments with a fairly rich feature set and easily managed Im giving it 5 stars.Ill be placing these into my client environments as new switches are needed. Well done Netgear.Hope this helps someone!", "unixReviewTime": "1429574400"}

{"overall": 5.0, "reviewerID": "A2UL0DVTM8KVNV", "asin": "B0001FS9NE", "reviewText": "OverviewThis is a great array for someone looking to expand their home storage network or possibly someone with a SOHO setup that needs plenty of storage. I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.UnpackingThe array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.InstallationYou will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.HardwareAll hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.The array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.One HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.SoftwareThe CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90s, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.I did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.A nice feature is that the HDs SMART monitoring information is available via the arrays driver software.FeaturesThe amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.During my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.The BadThe only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.ConclusionThis is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00. It certainly is not enterprise class, but then again, neither is the price.", "unixReviewTime": "1332720000"}

I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I cant test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.  So the only gripe I have with small devices like this is that they are too light.  They are at the mercy of the weight of the cables plugged into them.  They need lead in the bottom to hold them in place.  Alrighty then.", "unixReviewTime": "1264032000"}

For instance, I have a PRISMIQ Media Player that hooks to the TV to watch videos and photos stored on the computer.That device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).I wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didnt want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.A bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the devices RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, its talking to a wired ethernet, even while its not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.Setup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devicess IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and thats it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesnt have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).Another bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, dont worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebooks ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and thats it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.The downside: Its expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive ethernet to Wi-Fi converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.The PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang g) and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps turbo mode in 802.11a! (havent tested it).", "unixReviewTime": "1099440000"}

It started early, in Message in a Haunted Mansion, and has been used poorly often (Trail of the Twister, Icicle Creek -- making the food, not the maid work, etc), but in this game it works. On a ranch, everyone pitches in. And really, the only thing you have to pitch in and do is collect eggs and vegetables, set up a camp fire, and feed the horses.Actually, the camp fire was the only time I cheated, because I couldnt figure out where to get the kindling. I totally glanced over the true source because I thought it was part of the scenery, so I had a good laugh when I looked at the cheat. Dont make my mistake players. Its right in front of your nose, I promise.The only chore I didnt like was the one that had nothing to do with the ranch, though it was also fair. You do something for the lady at the shop, and she does something for you in return. I just wish it hadnt been so trying to collect all the arrowheads. Though heres a word to the wise: You can collect them at any time. So when you see one in the game, pick it up. That way you have less work later.As a game, Id highly recommend it to new comers to the series. It isnt my favorite, but thats mostly because my favorites, if you look at them, generally follow the same pattern (find secret passageways!).

{"overall": 5.0, "reviewerID": "A1543Y65HXSXZP", "asin": "B0001XLSG6", "reviewText": "Owning nearly every game in the Nancy Drew PC series, Id have to say that one of the many things that HERInteractive excels at is the absence of repetition; Each and every one of their games feels unique and is lots of fun, although some may be more enjoyable than other ones. This one also has a unique location, a ranch in the Arizona desert. While sleuthing and the wild west dont seem like a match in your mind, this game is definitely an amazing edition to the series, and deserves a spot on any detectives game shelf.Story: 9/10. This game pretty much has two stories. Theres the fact that a glowing white horse gallops past the ranch occasionally at night, and when it does, bad things start to happen. Theres also the story that an outlaw named Dirk Valentine left treasure somewhere at or near the ranch. As the game went on, the two stories somewhat started to meld together, and it was super exciting seeing Dirk Valentines treasure hunt progress.Graphics/Setting: 9/10. For a game thats seven years old, the graphics are still pretty decent even by HERInteractive standards today. Sure, the characters movements are still robotic in this one, but the scenery makes up for it; Which brings me to one of the big highlights of this game, the setting. It was such an incredible idea to put Nancy Drew in the wild west and shortly live the life of a cow girl. The music was absolutely perfect for the setting, and it was a very realistic experience for a pc game.Atmosphere: 9.5/10. Definitely the best atmosphere of any game up to this point, and possibly of the whole series. The AMAZING music fit the game perfectly, and the backgrounds (not the real pictures), were very realistic, and although I played this game on a computer like all other games in this series, I felt somewhat attached to the games atmosphereCharacters: 8.5/10. The characters were decent this time around. You have three very different cowboys, and Mary Yazzie, a store owner a couple of miles away from the ranch. They each had their own distinct personalities, I just wish theyd shined through more often.Puzzles: 8/10. Not way too many puzzles this time around, which for me was definitely a positive. Most of them fit the game, and were a good balance in terms of difficulty.Ending: 9/10. A somewhat surprising and creepy ending. Its pretty simple, but still took me a few second chances to end the game.Total (averaged): 8.83 out of 10, rounded to....9/10.A truly unique and enjoyable Nancy Drew game, the atmosphere and story is top notch, and this game deserves a spot on any Nancy Drew fans shelf.", "unixReviewTime": "1313798400"}

I wondered myself back when this game first came out, as almost every game before this one had been a delight. When I finally played the game, it never failed to amaze me.Nancys going to Arizona with Bess and George, to visit her friends Aunt Bet and Uncle Ed at their new ranch in Phoenix. Nancy arrives before Bess and George (whose flights are consistently delayed), only to find that strange things have been happening at Shadow Ranch lately. According to legend, the horse of an outlaw named Dirk Valentine haunts the ranch, cursing those who see it with bad luck. After it appeared the night before Nancys arrival, a rattlesnake was found in Ed and Bets room and bit Ed! When it looks like these attacks seem to be choreographed, Nancy starts seeking the truth behind this phantom horse, its history, and the truth about what happened to a legendary treasure that Dirk left for his love who lived on Shadow Ranch years ago...The story became very gripping, and just who the culprit was going to be at the end was truly a mystery (pun slightly intended). There were quite a number of twists and turns that I never saw coming, but all were very tastefully handled. Overall, Id say this game has one of the best stories (and Id hope so - it *is* based on the bestselling Nancy Drew book of all time).The graphics were definitely the best upon the release of this game, and still continue to rival several of the more recently-released games. The characters are all wonderfully animated, and their gestures and body language is very realistic. The scenery was very detailed, and everything appeared almost as if it would if it were encountered in real life. I also liked how the phantom horse was animated whenever it appeared.All of the characters were rather likable, in the cases of both the phone friends and the suspects. Eventually, all of the suspects grew on me, to the point that Id be disappointed no matter who the culprit was. They were so lovable, and remain one of the best casts to appear in a Nancy Drew game yet.The suspects include Dave Gregory, the foreman of the ranch who seems very shy whenever hes around Nancy. Shorty Thurmond is the cook, whos as opposite to Dave as night is from day with his consistently running mouth and love of gossip. Tex Britten is the head wrangler, and has a very creepy aura and personality about him. Mary Yazzi is the first Native American character to appear in a Nancy Drew game, and she runs her own store on land adjacent to Shadow Ranch. They all fit together nicely, and the amount of interaction they have with Nancy is not only exceptional, but also the interaction they have with each other. Nearly all of them have something to say about each other, and we get to really understand how they get along with each other as well as with Nancy. This was such an awesome idea, as it makes the case much more believable and the characters all the more real and able to be related to.The puzzles and challenges were pretty enjoyable. Several were challenging, but not impossible. My favorites were the mini games in Marys shop and in Dry Creek (a ghost town that appears later on) and the cake baking challenge. I didnt really care for maze and flowers puzzles because they were exceptionally difficult, but two out of several isnt all that bad.I dont typically care for country music, so the soundtrack didnt stand out quite as much to me. However, this is just a personal taste, not a set-in-stone rule. Besides, the game *does* take place on a ranch. The soundtrack for this game should sound Western, right? So, regardless of the fact that I dont typically care for country, I have to say that the soundtrack is still as fitting and awesome as ever.While The Secret of Shadow Ranch does have a few setbacks, its a very strong Nancy Drew game. Id say it still holds up as one of the best, especially in terms of characterization and plot development. It earned its spot in the top 3 games packaged in the Collectors Edition Fan Favorites package, alongside Treasure in the Royal Tower and Curse of Blackmoor Manor. Even though its not a top five game for me, its definitely a top ten thats well worth hopping onto and riding to the players content.", "unixReviewTime": "1309219200"}
{"overall": 4.0, "reviewerID": "A13BTMCSLTQ48R", "asin": "B0001XLSG6", "reviewText": "This is the 3rd Nancy Drew game Ive played (my previous two were #12 and #13) and I cant say its my favorite. I REALLY wanted to like this game too! Im a horse junkie, and a ND junkie, and I was all excited for the two to come together, but it just didnt work out for me, unfortunately. Im going to split by review up into sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.PLOT - 4/5: Nancy is invited to Shadow Ranch, which belongs to Bess and Georges aunt and uncle, the Rawleys.. But when she gets there, Bess and George are a no-show, and the Rawleys are in the hospital after Mr. Rawley got bitten by a rattlesnake. Nancy then learns that a mysterious glowing horse has been making nightly appearances at the ranch, and that everytime it shows up, a freak accident happens. She also learns about a outlaw named Dirk Valentine who, in the 1800s, was in love with a girl who lived on Shadow Ranch, and supposedly left her a hidden treasure somewhere. Could Dirk Valentines treasure have something to do with the horse? Is there really a treasure? Who will stop the horse before something really bad happens? Well, its up to you, as Nancy Drew!This is practically the same plot as Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon (I guess it would be the other way around, cause this game came out first, but I played Last Train first so its backwards for me) so it didnt really catch my attention. The plot was executed pretty well, though, but I still prefer Last Train. Everyone says how much fun the horseback riding was, but I didnt think it was that cool. You just point and click, same as always, except theres a horse head in front of you. But I will admit that by the end of the game, my horse Bob and I were pretty tight.CHARACTERS - 4/5: The characters were good in this game. They werent really THAT much fun to talk to (except Bess and George), but some of them were intersting. Tex is the horse wrangler guy, hes tough, mean, down-right scary looking, and he doesnt have much to say. Mary Yazzie owns the gift store near the ranch, her character was boring and her voice was really annoying. The cook, Shorty, was nice, it was funny how he always wanted to gossip with Nancy, but I thought he was creepy looking, like a big scary teddy bear. The foreman, Dave, was quiet, but it was really sweet how he had a crush on Nancy. And Charleena wasnt that cool cause all you did was talk to her on the phone. Overall, I think they did a good job on the characters, they werent amazing, but the voice acting was good (except Mary IMO) and the graphics for them were also good.SETTING - 4.5/5: This game is set in Arizona, and I think that the makers of this game did a great job getting that desert feeling. The decorations in the house were just perfect, and the ranch looked so realistic. The ghost town was pretty spooky, and the desert was barren, as it should be. The only problem I had with the setting was the music! The song was good at first but then it just got really annoying and repetitive. I would give the setting a 5 but for the song Im gonna have to knock off half a point.PUZZLES - 2/5: If you were to ask me what was the ONE thing that bothered me about this game, I wouldnt hesitate a second to say CHORES!!! I hated them! Fixing the wire and collecting the eggs wasnt so bad, but picking those vegetables, AHHH! I got sent home like 20 times for picking unripe vegetables. I mean really, who sends a guest home for picking an unripe tomato? I ended up printing out like a map of the garden from a walkthrough so that I knew which vegetables to pick. But those chores were just a total turn off. I felt like some of the other puzzles in the game were also hard, I spent like an hour trying to do that impossible magnet thing, then another hour hunting for arrowheads on the ground. It was just ridiculous. I dont know, mabye there were some really fun puzzles in this game, but I cant remember them cause all I remember is that awful garden. The puzzles in this game are really not my cup of tea.IS IT CHALLENGING?: YES! Unless if your an expert at collecting vegetables, baking cakes, spending hours searching the ground for arrowheads, and solving invisible puzzles. Id give it a 5/5 for challenge, but its not challenging in a fun way.ENDING - 4/5: The ending is good. The maze at the end is confusing, definitely challenging. And if it werent for a walkthrough I wouldnt have ever guessed how to catch the culprit. I was kind of surprised by who the culprit was and what their motive was. Overall the ending was good.FINAL SCORE:Plot: 4Characters:4Setting: 4.5Puzzles: 2Challenge: 5Ending: 4= 23.5 divided by 6 = 3.91, Ill give it a 4 overall, but a 3 for fun.", "unixReviewTime": "1283817600"}

I still liked this game, but I kept expecting HERinteractive to step it up.Story-Bess and Georges Aunt Bet and Uncle Ed invite you (along with Bess and George) to their ranch in Arizona.  When you arrive, Bess, George, Aunt Bet, and Uncle Ed are all not there; and the hired hands wont tell you anything.  You soon find out that a phantom horse has been showing up, and everytime it shows up something bad happenns.  The latest catastrophe is that Uncle Ed got bitten by a rattlesnake and had to go to the ER.Graphics-Just a little bit better.  I keep expecting it to just get WOW better, but it never does.  The lips actually match the words much better, though.Sound-Along with that, the voice acting for one of the characters you talk to is fabulous, while the other three characters seem bored.  This is actually the first game where I felt some voice actors/actresses werent giving it their all.  The music is country which I didnt really like or dislike.  It went with the story, so that was good enough for me.Gameplay-Everything is the same (first person; point-and-click; etc.) except you get around via horse.  It actually takes longer than in other games, and it can get quite boring.  Another boring thing are the puzzles.  Half of the puzzles are chores such as getting the eggs, feeding the horses, etc.  Its not brain-challenging at all, and for this reason I gave the fun rating 3 stars.Fun-Like I said this game is OK, but the puzzles arent really fun.  The story is fun, though, expecially the back story with Bess and George, but the puzzles are just work.  I hate work.Length-This game is about 10 hours straight through.  However, I wish they would have taken out the chores even if it resulted in lowering the game to 8 hours.  Seriously, the chores take about 2 hours in total.A good game that has boring puzzles.  With this game I was really wanting HERinteractive to come out with something great; unfortunately, the didnt.

The maze drove me insane.One puzzle in particular made me roll my eyes because the way you find the solution is utterly dumb. Youre looking for a really old piece of information, and Bess and George, stuck at the airport, happen to find a book that contains exactly what you need to know. And by old, I mean like a hundred years old. It was so contrived. Then again, I couldnt think of anything better, either.Gameplay: A +The new game interface features a wider screen and an inventory you have to open to access. I thought the wide screen was great but the extra clicking irritated me, because if you may miss the little button to close it or change pages. You get used to it, though.Western life comes alive at Shadow Ranch, where you repair the chicken coop, perform daily tasks and always take care of your horse when you get back to the stable or Tex will have something to say to you!Other fun in the game includes invesitgating a ghost town, learning to use a lariat (lasso) and completing a barrel race in under ten seconds.You know how I said that DDI has everything but romance? Shadow Ranch has romance in spades. Its divine.Time Changes: This one takes place in three days. When you complete the tasks for a certain day, it will automatically change to night.Voice Acting: ARaspy-voiced grump Tex sounds a lot like grumpy Red Knott from GDML (same voice actor) but it was nice to hear him again, like a phone call from an old friend.

The reason I did not give Secret 5 stars is because a few of the puzzles, such as having to collect vegetables and eggs twice are just plain boring. However, you get a real feel for the old west as the graphics are excellent. The Indian relics and ruins and the ghost town are very well done and the indoor scenes are great, such as Shadow Ranch Lodge, Marys Gift shop and Cappys, the remnant of an old saloon.The horse lore that you will learn such as the proper term for each horse color is downright interesting. And as a ranch hand youll be obliged to put a dismembered bridle together, feed the three horses and the chickens their various rations, bake a cake, run a barrel race and ride your faithful horse Bob to interesting places, sleuthing all the way.The puzzles cover a pretty wide gamut of difficulty from the very easy (the vegetables and eggs and the chicken wire fence repair) to the reasonably hard-the Indian ruins maze. The number and variety of puzzles should please just about everybody except, perhaps, accomplished and sophisticated gamers. The latter would find The Curse of Blackmoor Manor a much bigger challenge for their abilities.The voice acting is first rate and the lip synch and gestures are fine. Tex, the onery cowboy with an incredibly deep voice, is very funny. Dave, another ranch hand, is very cute, as Nancy noticed and points out.

The reason Ive given it 4 stars instead of 5 (the first time Ive done that with this series) is because there are several places where what you have to do to move on is illogical, and for these same areas, there isnt any hints to let you know what to do.  As a result, I wound up having to consult UHS Hints (a really good website where you can find hints to all the Nancy Drew games) a lot more than I would have liked...Shadow Ranch is situated in the Arizona Desert - and the graphics of this area are great!  The mystery surrounds strange happenings that are occuring on the ranch - such as a phantom horse riding through at night, always accompanied by a major mishap at the ranch (a snake bite, power lines become downed, pump house floods).Nancy finds out early in the game that there are rumors about an old bank robber who had hidden a treasure for his sweetheart - who used to live at the ranch.  So your job, as Nancy Drew, teen detective, is to 1. find out who or what is behind all of the strange mishaps - are they linked to the phantom horse, or does it just appear that way?  And 2. find the treasure - if there is one...In order to get around the desert, you get to ride a horse - be sure to look around at everything you can find about riding horses before you begin, or you just might find yourself falling off a lot!!!Overall, I found this game to be fun to play, although it did become quite frustrating at times...  If you find yourself having difficulty as I did, Id recommend going to the UHS hints website - they allow you to choose how many hints to take, and you can always get a few before youre given the full answer - this way, if you just need a push in the right direction, you dont have to see the full answer and ruin the fun of figuring out for yourself.", "unixReviewTime": "1134864000"}

However, Nancy arrives at the airport to a less-than-warm welcome from a ranch hand, only to find that Ed Rawley was bitten by a rattlesnake and is in hospital.  As if that wasnt enough excitement, cousins Bess and George are stranded at the airport due to bad weather, so Nancy has to explore by herself.A phantom horse has been sighted on the ranch just before bad things happen (broken pipes, downed power lines, rattlesnake bites),and its up to teenage supersleuth Nancy to get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding a historical romance that unfolded on the ranch between Frances Humber, daughter of the local sheriff, and outlaw Dirk Valentine.  Before he died, Dirk buried his treasure for Frances to find using a series of hidden clues, and the treasure remains somewhere on ranch property.  Besides Shadow Ranch, Nancy gets to explore a canyon full of petroglyphs, a Native American shop, a ghost town, and abandoned cave dwellings.There are a number of suspects: Dave the ranch hand, Tex the head wrangler, Shorty the cook, and Mary Yazzie, a Native American jeweler. Nancy meets other characters over the phone, including a famous novelist, the local sheriff, and the Rawleys.Several new features have been added, including a larger game window, which I liked, although navigating a full inventory could be confusing at times.  Nancy gets to learn about horses, barrel racing and how to use a lariat.  To get from place to place (there are six major locations), Nancy rides Bob the quarter horse.  Nancy can search for information on the web with her cell phone, which provides numerous hints as to how to solve puzzles. There is a strong educational element here, as Nancy sifts through information on not only ranch life (cattle branding, barrel racing, picking vegetables, feeding horses), but numerous other topics (knitting, agates, petroglyphs, flowers).I liked the nature of the puzzles, although many reviewers complained about the repetitive chores, including daily egg collecting, vegetable picking, cake baking, and feeding the animals.  Nancy is expected to help out during her visit by performing tasks for various characters, including putting together a bridle, collecting eggs and vegetables, arranging a jewelry display, and collecting arrowheads.  There are a fair number of slider puzzles and several mazes. This game is more difficult than others in the series but not as hard as Secret of Blackmoor Manor.Secret of Shadow Ranch had a very strong story, good character development, excellent music (Spanish guitar, country western, scary music in the ghost town that will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck), improved graphics, well integrated puzzles, and a satisfying conclusion (which I didnt find in Secret of Blackmoor Manor).

I cannot use Vista because of accessibility problems so I have to use XP.2008-05-08The Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 3 makes changes to XP that severely affect accessibility for people with some forms of epilepsy. I suspect that Microsoft is partially trying to install some Vista style features ( ripped off from Apple ). In particular, I have seen Apple style sliding down menu boxes or whatever they are called. As an example, open the control panel applet. BEFORE, it was accessible, NOW, the elements at the top of the left column slide down. I had enough bad seizures ( bad in this case means very unpleasant - I can actually feel them in my brain ) that, after experimenting trying to disable this abomination, at had to get away from the computer.For people like me, my computer is my lifeline.

Vista is absolutely not accessible, as is Leopard, etc. With Microsoft destroying the minimal accessibility of XP, there is nowhere to go.IF YOU DECIDE TO INSTALL SP3 - FULLY BACKUP YOUR COMPUTER SO YOU CAN REVERT TO SP2 IF YOU HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS. ( I have two notebooks; if I cannot figure out a workaround, then I will never be able to install SP3 )BTW, I review so that other people like me can find information about products to avoid and so that they can realize that the problems that they are having are common to other people.

It is so bad that it is only a matter of years before we can no longer live in this society due to blinking, flashing, etc.Workaround:Control Panel | System | Advanced | Performance - SETTINGSUnclick EVERYTHING that allows animation, fading, sliding, etc. I am not sure how comprehensive this will be but it helps.BTW, FULL accessibility demands that the display be totally quiet as far as any unnecessary motion or blinking. Unnecessary features that make Windows XP inaccessible are, in particular, progress bars, animations for copying files. Microsoft Word has major accessibility problems.

With the introduction of SP2 in this minor update of Windows XP, Microsoft has decided to make the product secure, than it was thought to be in the beginning. But the past few years have been rough on Microsoft, with consistency in attacks on the product with such vulnerabilities as Trojans, buffer overflows, viruses and the most memorable of the all Blaster (August 2003).Ever since its debut, Windows XP has been causing a lot of headaches and wreaking havoc on corporate networks because of its susceptibility vulnerabilities that were not fixed in its initial release or Service Pack 1. So Microsoft decided to go back to the drawing board and decided to rethink what Windows XP should mean in terms of Security. At first Service Pack 2 was thought out to only be a minor Service Pack update with usual bug fixes, but because of the aforementioned problems Microsoft took new direction and after 1 year of testing we have finally reached a conclusion.SP2 is really apparent, based on my experience of installing the update, users displayed a welcome screen recommending Automatic Updates be turned on (and I would recommend too), after which the user is presented with the Security Center where you can configure the new and improved Firewall settings, such as which programs can access your PC. You also have the option of configuring your Anti-Virus program, unfortunately I have not been able to do so because my Anti-virus is not supported, although it seems (Norton Anti-virus Corporate Edition 7.6). Security Center is really the big change here and should have been implemented from beginning, but better late than never.Other great features which I and many users are undoubtedly thankful for include the Pop-Blocker which should have been included in IE 6 from the beginning (better late than never), its not 100 % percent effective but does a decent job so far of blocking most annoying Pop-Ups. I wish the Windows Team allowed users to train it, so if a Pop does succeed, you can tell the pop-up blocker engine that was a pop-up window and you shouldnt let that pass the next time, maybe Microsoft will let it improve over time. Other great improvements to IE in SP2 is the ability approve programs, so drive by downloads have become a thing of the past, anything you decide to download or accidentally clicked on a webpage has to be approved.Another wish is, better integration of the ActiveX controls with Microsofts own technologies, I notice that when I had to do a Office Update, the ActiveX API engine on Microsofts Office website had to be approved before I run the utility that checked for updates for Office products I needed.Microsoft has also streamlined Windows Update to be more user-friendly, you the user have the option for a Express or Custom install, Express only installs the most critical updates, while Custom allows to install the entire kitchen sink, including stuff some users can do without on Windows, (go with Express). Windows XP SP2 includes minor enhancements such as Windows Media Player 9, but why didnt Microsoft just wait a little longer and included Windows Media Player 10, which is already out? The blue tooth update is also a needed update, it wasnt intuitive right out of the box, but is more user friendly, all this, you can get for free if you are existing XP owner.Overall, if you havent upgraded to Windows XP yet from older versions of Windows, this is the time, but if you are an existing Windows XP user, I say skip this and just order the SP2 CD or download it from the Windows XP Website. I highly recommend users running prior versions of XP especially 95, 98, 98 SE, NT 4 and ME, maybe 2000 also move to XP, since Microsoft is planning on porting any of technologies in XP to those older versions of Windows, plus it has some great new features and you will love the Security technologies that provide a better experience for you the user.

But when you click on other versions, youre quickly told that all Powerquest products (that is, any partition magic version < 8) are obsolete and unsupported. They got rid of all the updates for PQMagic versions 3 to 7. Obviously Symantec is only interested in new sales and the dollars, not supporting former Powerquest customers (Partition Magic 7.0 is even listed and in stock for sale on Amazon.com!).PQMagic and Powerquest Drive Image have been always superior to Symantecs Ghost products. Yet now Symantec bundles the inferior Norton Ghost in a bundle with Partition Magic 8.Its sad to see such a great company and their products destroyed by Symantecs corporate greed. Welcome to the Symantec partition resizing utility monopoly!. Symantec got rid of their main competitor and destroyed a product in the process. Its just sad.  For a good partition resizer check out V-Coms Partition Commander, and for disk imaging, I now use Acronis TrueImage. Both are for sale here in Amazon.com.

Despite all the monopolizing and heavy-handedness and rushed updates, I have always felt they did more good than harm.  I have yet to find a Microsoft product I didnt like... until now.In a word, Microsoft Money 2005 is horrible.  I only gave it 2 stars because it still beats paper and pen :)Now, if youre a new user, you probably wont notice anything bad about it and will continue on your merry way.  Bravo for you (just dont do anything online until they release the second patch (yes, theres already one out) since 2005 is apparently quite broken with respect to about 50% of the institutions it claims to support).If youre a previous Money user, pocket your $30 and invest it, using your old version to track the savings.  I was terribly disappointed in 2005.  To begin with, helpful features such as Bill Minder, dual category lists, in-register spending forecast and upcoming bills, are gone.  What have they been replaced with?  I have no clue.  As far as I can tell, theyve replaced them with a HUGE toolbar (a la MSN Explorer but without the option to resize) and a LOT of white space (the register displays about 30 lines max (on compressed view) and runs literally down to the bottom of the screen.)The home page actually displays less information (though it is prettier in a way) and the settings menu is a fiasco (again, much like MSN Explorer) with numerous hyperlinks that are not necessarily intuitive.From what I could tell, reconciliation seemed to work as expected, but seemed to offer less information than 2003 did.  I did not even take the time to get into investing since I uninstalled 2005 within 24 hours (and I am, without doubt, a give it time kind of person).  I honestly felt like I had less control over my finances (or at least less information with which to make informed decisions) and didnt want to risk botching up my portfolio.Thats about it.  I know its a short review and probably leaves many questions unanswered, but I had only invested 24 hors in 2005 so a roll back to 2003 was fairly straightforward (and evidently necessary).  To take more time would have meant a more difficult reversal.  Again, I normally like MS products, but I can promise you this one will be going back to Redmond at their expense (30-day Money Back Guarantee).I would STRONGLY recommend against buying Money 2005.  It just isnt worth the money (I honestly wouldnt even take it free now).  I can see no enhanced functionality and it actually appears reduced in places.  The interface has been radically changed and, aside from being pretty, actually reduced my sense of control over my finances.  Again, if youre brand new to Microsoft Money, I think youll be satisfied.  However, if youre a previous user... well... youve been warned...PS Did I tell you that Money automatically (read: Did not ask) reorganized my categories?  It decided to treat Dining out as its own primary category instead of as a subcategory of Food, effectively reorganizing over 100 transactions.  This might have been OK if Money had asked, but it didnt.  Makes me wonder what else was changed without my approval...", "unixReviewTime": "1095811200"}

This time, I downloaded the trial version of Money 2005, and it loaded the old-format file without a hitch.  And the mysterious error message is no more!Money is cool because it makes it easy to keep track of your accounts, esp. for someone like me with dozens of banking and brokerage accounts (many from the days of Internet bubble when banks were giving away free money for opening accounts -- I knew I needed a real job...).  Its generates useful reports to track your networth, by category or over time.  Even for someone like me with lots of small accounts but little to show in the aggregate, its immensely useful.Should you get Money 2005, or upgrade from an earlier version?I cant really help you with that question.  But I do have a couple suggestions:1) Download the 30-day trial copy of the program from Microsofts website and give it a test drive.  I tried it on my two laptops and both copies worked perfectly, which led me to doubt the truthfulness of a lof of these reviews from so-called Im not anti-Microsoft people.  (No, yours truly doesnt work for Microsoft or get paid by them in any way.)2) For a peace of mind, make a manual backup copy of your existing Money file in Windows Explorer.  Just go into My Computer or Windows Explorer, find the Money file (its usually in My Documents; its extension is .mny), and use copy-and-paste to make a copy.  Keep the backup copy in a different folder.  Better yet, zip the backup copy for extra security. :)Try the program and judge for yourself if it works fine on your PC.

I prefer two distinct selections because its quicker to enter and easier to find my subcategories.  Microsoft provides a Registery edit in the following Knowledgebase article:[...]I used the edit, and my separate lists are restored.  Great, but I am irritated that Money 2005 removed this option and provided no way for a user to change this behavior short of a Registery hack.On the 2nd problem, my ability to Transfer amounts to different account was resolved once I split my subcategory lists from my category lists using the above Registery hack.  Now, transfers operate as they did in Money 2003, which is the last version I was using.On the 3rd problem, one financial institution has, for the 2nd time, downloaded duplicate accounts.  I hope its an anomoly, but well see.  Other accounts operate fine.I havent explored the strengths of 2005 yet -- this was just post-upgrade issues Ive wrestled with over the New Years weekend.  On the surface, doesnt look like much new is useful to me.On the matter of online bill payment, I already had that through Wachovia bank (formerly First Union).  I guess whats new is that Microsoft now makes bill payment through Money work with many institutions.  Since Wachovia already provided this function, I dont think Im adversely affected...or benefitted (though Wachovia dropped the $6 monthly fee for using Moneys bill payment function).One final piece of advice:  after you install, dont open your Money data file unless/until you have had Money perform all its software updates.  For me, I opened my Money 2003 file, was prompted to convert to Money 2005 file format, and then Money 2005 automatically downloaded software patches afterwards.  Wondering whether my conversion worked right nor not, I chose to open a backup of my Money 2003 data file using the patched copy of Money 2005, so any software bug fixes related to data conversion were already installed in Money 2005.I gave it a 2-star rating based solely on the upgrade process.

The little magnifying-glass icon at the top right of the menu bar brings up Spotlight quick search. Enter a word or phrase and instantly (once the index is built) files matching by name or content will be shown to you. When you first run your Mac using Tiger, it will automatically build a Spotlight index, which can take a few hours, depending on the number and size of the files on your disk(s). The speed at which Spotlight can find files is astounding. Even if you search for a word buried in an obscure location, Spotlight can find it.Dashboard Widgets: These are mini-applications.

Such items as a desk clock, calendar, weather monitor and iTunes player are readily usable and hundreds more can be downloaded, both from Apple and third-parties.RSS in Safari: Now Safari is RSS capable.

I truly hadnt thought that I would get much use out of this, but tapping f12 to check in on the weather report or look up the exact definition of a word has become something I do regularly.Spotlight works wonderfully to find practically any information that you could want on your computer, and it finds it amazingly fast. It brings back results that are both faster and more useful than any other hard drive searching method Ive come across.Automator is something that mostly power users are going to love, but its a relatively simple way to make a series of actions you might do frequently into a process that you initiate and the computer takes care of the rest.For those who like to develop applications or just try out writing a little bit of code, Tiger also includes a copy of the latest version of xCode, which is rapidly gaining popularity for developing OS X software (and it can easily be used to write and modify code in languages like Java that will run on other systems as well).Theres a long list of other improvements, though many of them are deep enough in the system that a casual user wont immediately notice them.  What you will notice is that the applications you use are running faster than ever, because while Apple has released CoreAudio and CoreVideo so that developers can make better use of your video and soundcards and get some of the audiovisual load off of your processor.OS X Tiger is now up to version 10.4.1, with 10.4.2 rumored to be in the pipeline on its way to release.

Another con is that there is a documented conflict with Creative Media Source GO!; if you have both load on start up, Internet Security will not function (if you let IS load first and then manually start Media Source, however, it is OK).All in all, I would only recommend this product if you can get it for Free after rebates--a deal that comes up fairly often, if you are looking for it (you will still pay taxes and any postage, depending on your state).  At that price it is a good deal.  At its usual price of $60, it is highway robbery.  Im thinking Ill try PC-Cillin next, [...].", "unixReviewTime": "1105660800"}

I really liked the 2004 version and have had no major problems with it other than once my computer boots, I always had to go into NIS properties to see if my EMAIL SCANNING said ON or ERROR.  Evidently, something on my computer will occassionally cause the email scanning to not load properly, so if it showed ERROR - I would have to reboot and then it would be ok.  I should point out that Norton Support Staff told me even though email scanning said error, the computer is still protected by the auto-protect feature if it is turned on.  Minor inconvenience, but other than that, I was very happy with the program.The same holds true for the new 2005 - I still have the occassional email scanning error, but there are a few new  irritating things happening.  While the software works fine, it has tremendously SLOWED DOWN the launch of Outlook Express and it even hangs a second or two when I close it.  Also, if you open NIS properties screen, when I am finished, I hit the X button to close, but it takes like 2-3 seconds before it will close.  Even though these are just a few seconds, it really irritates me because I have a very fast computer.However, something that really excites me about this new NIS is that the hard drive scan of all files by Norton Anti-Virus seems to take a lot less time than it did with a previous version.  Being a stickler for speedy computer processing, this is definitely a plus.So, overall, this program works OK and keeps me protected, but I still think there are minor issues they need to work on as mentioned and I also think that the average computer user is not given enough information about whether to allow certain things when a firewall warning appears.  I know so many people that have blocked innocent programs and found that they are unable to use them or get on the internet.  There should be a way for NIS to know what is innocent and what should be blocked... the average computer user doesnt have the time to research what they should block or not - in fact, isnt that the reason we use computers?  They are supposed to be able to do the work FOR US!!!!", "unixReviewTime": "1098662400"}

For this version I only recommend that you upgrade to Norton Anti-virus 2005, no major differences except for a more sleeker interface and the obvious PC performance drop. Doesnt even include features your getting for free in Windows like a FireWall, which comes free with SP2 for Windows XP. The introduction of technology such as Activation was not smooth, and caused a lot of headaches which only makes the product less embracing than it use to be.Symantec needs focus on areas such as Speed, Seamless Integration with Windows, obviously it has lost it. My next purchase from Symantec wont be in the retail line, but from Enterprise space. The Corporate Edition of Norton Antivirus, it offers all the tools I want for protecting my PC, yes it cost a lot and its targetted towards the Large Networks, but it is so subtle and easy to use and it does not bog down your PC.So, should you upgrade?If recently purchased System Works 2004 or Norton 2004 or any of the Symantec line of products at least wait until your one year subscription is up.

The following little review has been written in response to those complaints:One of the biggest complaints that I read about Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security is the cost. For me, however, the annual upgrade on Norton Products always ends up free--at least it has since the turn of the millenium. Inevitably if you wait long enough their rebates come out that make the upgrade to the new product absolutely cost free. This holds true even with their full suite which may retail at $70, but Ive managed to get 5 copies for various computers I manage at a final cost to me of $0. Actually, with Amazon.com because I get a discount because of the A9 search engine, I think Ive managed to earn a couple of bucks by installing Norton Internet Security. Next year, Ill use the rebates to do the same.With Internet Security, the concerns of many people who are against Norton and Symantec (especially firewall) with the exception of the resource hog issue (Symantec really needs to address this issue) are handled.Symantec needs to fix their technical service side of things by offering free help of at least some sort. They need to tone down the issues of resource hogging. But as lon as they offer me free upgrades every year and consistently maintain virus-free computers (6 years virus free on all on the computers Ive managed: usually 5-7 at one time) Ill stick with Symantec. Nevertheless, despite these pitfalls, as long as I can keep upgrading for free and my systems remain virus-free, Norton is my source for internet security.[...]", "unixReviewTime": "1116633600"}

(For those who dont know, Peter Norton made a name for himself in the 80s by co-writing a bunch of useful programs called Norton Utilities for MS-DOS and also writing a bunch easy-to-read reference books on PCs and DOS.)The latest version of Norton Antivirus is simply the worst.  It requires activation, but thats the least of its sins.  Scanning is slow, and it misses lots of trojans and worms.  It also takes up a huge chunk of RAM, and occasionally can crash, esp. doing live update.  Speaking of which, the product installs lots of useless programs without your permission.

More than once Ive heard people say that its one of the best (if not the best) titles in the series. But it also has a reputation for being fairly scary and having very complicated puzzles. I guess it was that reputation that turned me off to this game, but I finally ended up buying it because I felt like I couldnt call myself a true Nancy Drew fan without having played Curse of Blackmoor Manor. Im going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.PLOT  5/5:  This was one of the most interesting plots Ive come across in a ND game. Nancy has been asked by her neighbor, Mrs. Petrov, to fly to England and help her daughter. Her daughter Linda recently married a British diplomat named Hugh Penvellyn, but since her wedding Lindas attitude has drastically changed. She has become short tempered and paranoid and constantly getting sick, and by the time Nancy gets to Blackmoor Manor Linda has hidden herself away in her bedroom and refuses to show her face to anyone.  Blackmoor Manor has a storied reputation of secrets and witchcraft and for generations locals have believed it to be haunted by a werewolf-like monster called the Beast of Blackmoor. Its up to Nancy to get to the bottom of all of this to help Linda.Like I said, I thought this plot was fascinating. There was so much detail put into the history of Blackmoor and the Penvellyn family history and I had so much fun unravelling it all as the plot went on. It was a great length and held my interest the whole time. I really have no complaints about the plot.CHARACTERS  4.5/5: There was a really great cast of characters in this game. There was Linda, who I thought was very interesting and I wished I could have interacted more with her. The other residents of the house were Jane, Lindas 12 year old step daughter (also one of my new favorite characters), Hugh Penvellyns aunt Mrs. Drake, and Nigel, a historian who is currently researching Blackmoor Manor for a book he is writing on the Penvellyn family. There was also Janes tutor Ethel, but Ethel was different because you could only talk to her a couple of times over the course of the game. There was also Loulou, the annoying hint parrot. I really enjoyed the voice acting work and impressed overall with the characters.SETTING  4.5/5: Blackmoor Manor was definitely an interesting place. It reminded me a lot of Wickford Castle from Treasure in the Royal Tower  especially the main hall. Blackmoor Manor was excessively decorated so there was plenty to look at even if some parts of it were pretty gaudy. It was huge and there was a ton to explore, not to mention lots of areas unlocked over the course of the story. I also really enjoyed the music in this game.PUZZLES - 4/5: This was a puzzle heavy game. The puzzles ranged from ones that were quick and self-explanatory to ones that were incredibly complicated and took many different steps to complete. I used a walkthrough for most of it. I did appreciate how well thought out the puzzles were, however some of them were so long and complicated that it felt daunting having to complete them. There werent really any chores in this game, which was good. The only thing that could come close to counting as a chore was that Jane required you to play a game with her before she would do anything for you. This was a little annoying but luckily her games were easy.IS IT CHALLENGING? Absolutely. There was no way I could have figured out some of those puzzles without a walkthrough. 4.5/5ENDING - 4/5: The ending was good, but not as strong as the other aspects of the game. The reveal at the end and the appearance of the culprit was kind of abrupt and a little underwhelming. The culprits motives made sense but I didnt really like who they chose as the culprit. But catching them was exciting and I liked how everything was wrapped up in the epilogue.FINAL SCORE:Plot: 5Characters: 4.5Setting: 4.5Puzzles: 4Challenge: 4.5Ending: 4= 26.5, divided by 6 = 4.41 rounded to 4 stars", "unixReviewTime": "1434585600"}

This lady detective heads on over to a 14th century English manor  reputed to hold a startling family history of intrigue, chaos, and scandal! Also, in recent events, a full-fledged curse involving a dangerous beast marauding the moors!  But to get down to business, she seeks why her neighbors daughter is suffering from a strange case of [lycanthropy?}INITIAL SCORE: 93CHARACTERS:Linda Penvellyn : I love a mysterious woman, but this is ridiculous! I really dont get the anger issues now that the plot reveal indicates the TRUE source of her ailments.  Was this just a woman who cannot handle stress or does she have other deep-seeded issues?I still have no idea what she looks like and I am not buying the game cover art because she was not involved in any real part of the storyline.Jane Penvellyn : I really loved playing those games with her and I spanked her more times than not.  I sensed a little attitude with her at the end. I didnt know how to take that...Mrs. Drake: I thought I would see more of her than I did especially since she was a main presence in the day-to-day events of the manor.  Then again, I never really enjoyed talking to her so I guess it was for the best.Nigel Mookerjee:  A writer that was hired by Mrs. Drake to finally throw an encompassing tell-all [in a positive light] book revealing the exploits of the Penvellyn name.  I thought he was okay in general, but the typing test he had me perform was idiotic.Ethel Bosinny: I really wanted to learn more about her and the fact that she startled me a couple time was really laughable. I probably never jumped in a ND game before, but they GOT me! :)  I wanted to learn more about what rituals/customs she was intent on passing down through the family lineage with Jane.Ned Nickerson : Supportive as always.Loulou: A parrot that really DID get on your nerves after awhile. The voice was poorly-acted [sounding like a human mimicking a parrot] by whatever actor was in charge of that performance.  Also, if you were going to add catch-phrases, try adding at least TEN more. We are going to need a bigger boat. only goes so far after the 12th time heard.CUMUL SCORE: - 4 = 89SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:One of the best scores I have heard in a ND game to date! Very enticing and it got you into the spirit of the adventure. Graphics, although not top-notch as the others, had designers working 24/7 because the immensity of what they had to  accomplish. So many areas of the manor were majestically done!CUMUL SCORE: + 4 = 93PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES:  I agree with past reviewers that there was a certain level of puzzle-solving that made it too hard for the casual gamer.  Mindlessly strutting around looking for leads would have added an extra five hours to my gameplay NEEDLESSLY, if I didnt short-cut with a walkthrough [didnt cheat the actual puzzles mind you]. I think they were too difficult for their own good and am trying very hard to remember if I actually enjoyed any of them.  The only thing that comes to mind is Skull & Bones and how Jane would ask  Do you have any SPY-dehs?? in her english accent. :) Go Dig!CUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 94ADVENTURE ENDING: Now I dont mind not getting the culprit right, but when the set-up doesnt equal the payoff, I can get pretty upset. Why was I bothered to learn about this family in a historical sense? Okay, I forgive that, but here is what is NOT forgivable....absolutely no character  resolutions for the player.1) What was that wolf thing in the bushes? Was it real? If not, explain how it was faked! Same poor excuse like in SAWE2) Could Lindas ailments actually happen according to the explanation? No!3) What became of Linda except the family [Hugh/Linda/Jane] learned to grow together. I want instant reactions to what happened immediately when the culprit was revealed...not a flimsy gloss-over going forward.4) No TRUE culprit punishment after all I invested? [13 game hours]5) What happened to all the side characters and their finality?CUMUL SCORE: - 10 = 84* PART 2 *I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were totake weeks! Well, it took me four days  and I gave myself aDetective Score Of : 56My Strong Points: I battled to stay interested to the history of the family and even  memorized their family tree! [Where did that ultimately get me? 97% useless knowledge]  I solved the difficult games, but lets face it,  I am not spending four hours monkeying around with moving walls again and again. Why did I have to CONSTANTLY maneuver the gargoyle & dragon to enter the West & East secret rooms? Couldnt the developers put it as RESOLVED instead of the tediousness of doing the steps ten times throughout the game? I punished myself nonetheless, but especially because I had the culprit all wrong.My Weak Points: General frustration with the game interface and it clouded my judgements on the linear tasks ahead.OVERALL GAME SCORE: 84 + 56/ 2 = 70 [ C - ]BOTTOMLINE: Ill not begrudge HER on how they wanted to resolve the main plotline, but for God Sakes clean up the ending so the Nancy Drew fans have some resolution on the other fifteen things that were occuring. We have invested countless hours and I learned nothing of how certain tricks were done and why.

That being said, if you like your games more straight forward, you probably wont enjoy this game as much. But thats ok too, theres a hints and tips forum on HerInteractive that you can check for assistance. And I promise, this game is worth completing.My one complaint about it would be that I would have liked to have done more with two of the characters. One mostly just ignored you when you spoke to her (and I understand, she was very, very sick, but I wish we could have had more conversations with her) and the other only appeared a few times and you were never able to seek her out. I would have loved to have been able to speak to her.But really, theyre minor complaints.

And I thank the creator for that because that creates amazing games.If youre ready to take a challenge and be scared a bit, then youre ready for this game. But if youre looking for something a bit easier to complete, I suggest picking up Treasure in a Royal Tower instead. It isnt scary by any means, but other than that it has a lot of the same things this game does. Rich history and a lot of exploring. If youre looking for an easier scary game...well, they havent actually produced an easy scary game yet (and I dont think Haunted Mansion/Ghost Dogs count as scary, Malloy is a meh game and I dont recommend it to anyone, and Shadow at Waters Edge, while being pretty scary, is also a bit on the hard side).", "unixReviewTime": "1338768000"}

Although I usually like the dark ones the least, something about this game was very gravitational. When I first started it, little did I know that not only Id actually like it even a little, but Id write a somewhat decent review on it.Story: 7.5/10. Orginially, Nancy shows up at Blackmoor Manor, a massive mansion in England, to find out what is wrong with newlywed Linda Penvellyn, who wont show her face or communicate with anyone, with the exception of a few words. Upon Nancys arrival, weird things start happening fast, and its clear that theres either a supernatual being in the residency, or someone really doesnt want Nancy there. The Penvellyn family is HUGE, and it was considerably fascinating to uncover more and more history.Graphics/Setting: 7.5/10. The characters are still robotic at this point in the series, but theyre slowly improving. Since you stay indoors the whole time (which was a negative aspect for me), you got to really see the detail in the mansion, but boy is there a lot. The manor makes you feel very small, and its full of a lot of surprises and secrets waiting to be uncovered.Characters: 7/10. The characters were considerably good this time around. To name a few, theres the intentionally nice but slightly irritating girl Jane, the hired author, Nigel whos writing a Penvellyn memoir, and Mrs. Drake, a strict and uptight lady. Theres also Loulou the parrot, whos helpful and funny, but annoying at times.Puzzles: 7/10. Even though I had to use a walkthrough for almost all of the puzzles, they still took a long time to get done. They really got you to think, but to the point where youre cranium hurt! I think this game sort of over-did the puzzles because theyre soooo many. This isnt called the hardest Nancy Drew game for nothing.Activities: 5/10. There isnt anything really to do outside of the story progression, which I found very dissapointing. I realize that the point of these games is to sleuth and solve mysteries, but fun activities are a priority in my book, and this game just didnt have any.Ending: 7/10. Maybe the most simple ending yet in the series. Somewhat surprising as well.Total: 7.33, rounded to the final score of....7.5/10.While I may be a tad biased because I dont usually enjoy the darker games, this game does deserve a purchase for many Nancy Drew PC fans, but Id go with something else for now.", "unixReviewTime": "1313798400"}

First of all, this is the first Nancy Drew game to take place somewhere outside of the continental United States, which deserves recognition in and of itself (yes - Nancys FINALLY going out of the country to solve a case!). Secondly, Nancys suspect list has always before been equally populated by men and women, or has had two or three men to one woman. For the first time, Nancy has a case with mostly female suspects (three females and one male). I found this very interesting, and nicely thought through. Thirdly, this is one of the most challenging and frightening Nancy Drew titles, and was advertised as the most so when it was released.Not only is the game revolutionary, but its also awesome. The storyline is very intense, and the history surrounding Blackmoor Manor is so richly detailed. Its amazing to see how much thought mustve gone into this game, and I imagine it took more effort from the creators than ever before.A young woman named Linda has recently married Hugh Penvellyn, a wealthy British diplomat, and has gone over to start a new life with him and his stepdaughter in England. They live together in Blackmoor Manor, where the Penvellyns have lived for hundreds of years. However, shortly after she moves in, Linda begins to feel sickly and starts behaving bizarrely. She throws fits, hides behind a bed curtain all day, and refuses to eat healthy food. Nobody knows whats caused this change in her, and in a fit of desperation, her mom (who still lives in America) calls Nancy to ask her if she could fly out to England to find out whats happening to Linda.Once she arrives in Blackmoor Manor, Nancy hears a sinister-sounding creature call out her name. When she looks around, she sees a pair of glowing eyes staring at her. Mrs. Drake, an elderly woman whos been taking care of the manor, answers the door, but not before the creature leaves. Mrs. Drake seems skeptical of what Nancy claims to have seen, but that doesnt stop Nancy from investigating. She soon discovers that one of the Penvellyns to own Blackmoor Manor was burned at the stake for witchcraft hundreds of years ago, and a beast shes rumored to have created had been prowling the moors for years. Could this beast have now returned? And why? And what (if anything) does it have to do with Linda? The answers to all these questions and more can only be found by solving this case...This is probably one of the most unique plots in the Nancy Drew series.  This is the first time when shes not called in to investigate high-profile crimes, like murder, threats, vandalism, kidnapping, theft, and the like. Curse of Blackmoor Manor is also the first game to feature a family struggle thats turned into a mystery that Nancy is now called to solve. I enjoyed this plot quite a bit, and felt it was quite refreshing.Blackmoor Manor is beautifully detailed. The graphics used in this game are superb, and even though it was released way back in 2005, the gaming quality and graphics still rival many games today. I really cant complain about the graphics, save for the fact that Janes appearance might seem a tiny bit disproportional (but shes also young, short, and sitting down on a bed, which is hard to animate).This game featured A LOT of puzzles, but they were all very well-explained and served a purpose for being there. I liked them all, and even though others might complain, I personally cannot. I also liked exploring the manor, which is rather large and has many places and things to see. My sole complaint is that at least half of the exploration takes place in the secret passageways, and I wouldve liked to see more of the outer surface of Blackmoor Manor.There were also lots of fun mini games to play, so the player can find something else fun to do in the game if theyre bored with solving puzzles and want to take a break from the mystery. The character Jane has several games that Nancy can play with her. All of them have to be played at least once to progress the game in some way, but they can all be played again as much as the player wants to (Janes always up for play!).All of the characters were very well-developed, and all had reason for being at the manor while Nancy was staying there. They also all had something to benefit by causing the haunting and horror surrounding Blackmoor Manor, and for terrorizing poor Linda. The first suspect met is Mrs. Drake, Hughs aunt with a self-righteous attitude and believes the British to be superior to the Americans in every way. Nigel Mookerjee is a historian whos been hired by Mrs. Drake to write a book on the Penvellyns, and is looking for something in the family history to spice things up for his book. Jane Penvellyn is Hughs 12-year-old daughter whos been forced to return to the manor after living in the United States for awhile, and seems to miss her biological mother very much. Ethel Bosinny is Janes private tutor who only appears every so often, and is very elusive and mysterious in the sense that she never seems to be found in the same place twice (nor can when shell appear be predicted).The other characters and phone friends are all pretty nicely integrated too. I absolutely loved the fact that Nancy can call Ned again (as he hadnt appeared in a game since The Final Scene), and the new method of getting hints that this game employed was very unique and fun. Rather than getting her hints from her phone friends, Nancy consults with Loulou, an 80-year-old female parrot whos residing in the manor. Loulou is very smart, and has quite a lot of funny comments to make about the case and everything involved. Shes very well-scripted, and I loved talking to her because of how much comedic relief she added to the game.All and all, the characters were great. I honestly didnt know who the culprit would be for sure until the end, but I did have my greatest suspicion leaning toward one particular person. This hunch was correct, but I was glad about that, as it employed two moves that needed to be done in culprit selection (one thatd never been done before, and one that was rarely done before). I wont say anything further, as I dont want to spoil it for those who havent played...Curse of Blackmoor Manor had a great musical score. I liked the traditional British feel of the music, and it definitely suited the location of the mystery. Every now and then, it also got more eerie, which also added to the overall fright factor.After being voted into the top three overall games, Curse of Blackmoor Manor was released in the Collectors Edition Fan Favorites pack with Treasure in the Royal Tower and The Secret of Shadow Ranch. Did it earn its spot there? For sure! This game brought a true revolution to the Nancy Drew games, and remains one of the best even to this date. Ive been playing this game for years, and I still jump a bit whenever I see phantoms and monsters creeping about the manor, watch clips of nightmares that Nancy has, or Ethel pops up in the middle of the night. Its a fun fright thats perfect for those whore willing to face their fears and solve one of the most terrifying cases that adventure gaming has ever known!", "unixReviewTime": "1310515200"}

This game finds Nancy in a creepy mansion in England attempting to find out why an old friend appears to be under a curse.  Her adventures take her all over the mansion, which is clearly hiding some secrets.  The mansion is delightfully spooky, and there are plenty of spooky happenings to add to the atmosphere.

Seriously, it was so much fun, and I was constantly getting chills from the scary storyline.  I was really needing this game as before this game HERinteractive wasnt really doing too great with their games.Story-Your neighbor has asked you to go to England to check on her daughter, Linda.  Linda has suddenly started hiding behind a curtain in her bedroom and refused to let anyone see her.  She has also started to have temper tantrums, which according to her mother are totally unlike her.  You soon realize that something supernatural may be behind this sudden change in behavior.Graphics-Okay, so these didnt get too much better, but they are still good.  All the spooky areas are dark, while the mansion is always lit up, and I did find the artwork rather well done.Sound-The voice acting was very good in my opinion as was the music.  There are lots of songs in this game, I thought, and I liked them all.Gameplay-Everything is the same except you dont leave the manor ever and the puzzles are HARD.  This was the first game where I found there were tons of puzzles and they were challenging without being frustrating.  Whenever you get stuck you can ask a parrot for hints, but you cannot call Bess and George in this game although you can call Ned.Fun-This game is so fun, and it is really scary, too.  I just want to mention that some people will not want to play this game because it does talk of witches, werewolves, alchemy, and rituals.  I didnt find it satanic or anything, but I think some people will want to skip this game if they dont like things like that.Length-I must have played this 1 or 2 months!  It was so fun!  And, still, when I replay it, it takes me 12-15 hours to finish.  It is really long, and I loved that!This is the perfect PC game that I recommend to everyone except those who are concerned about the above mentioned.

The woman has apparently become sick shortly after her new marriage. Rumors abound that the Beast of Blackmoor is creeping around, along with a family witch.Suspects include Lindas stepdaughter Jane Penvellyn, scholar Nigel Mookerjee, batty old Mrs. Drake, and Janes tutor Ethel Bosinny.The villain and the Penvellyn treasure were both RIDICULOUS. All that threatening atmosphere and chilling spookiness wasted on such silly things.Puzzles: CArgh! Just aargh! So many of them! And so tedious they were! The premise is that the Penvellyn family has a long and illustrious history of being geniuses of one kind or another. Each member of the family studied a certain subject, such as computers or astronomy. And they all left clues for future generations to a great hidden treasure (there it is again). The clues are all crazily scattered all over the manor, hidden in Latin crests and books and alchemical symbols.You also have to talk to an 80-year-old parrot to solve one puzzle. The family trusted a huge and important secret partly to a parrot that could keel over at any moment. (Yes, they live a long time, but not every parrot lives so long.)Other silly details include a revolving room and a strange map that somehow tracks your progress through an area, even though GPS wasnt invented way back when.They could have left out the anacronistic map, sure, but then we would have been in serious trouble. The gamers needed all the help they could get in this game. The puzles just kept going and going. The game was long and involved.Gameplay: CNancy is supposedly in England and we arent allowed to see a single bit of the English countryside. Why? Because Mrs. Drake doesnt want us tracking mud through the house. If I came a thousand miles to another country, nobody would stop me from taking a look outside! This game didnt even have to be set in England. It could have taken place in Salem, Mass. just as easily. (Of course, the Penvellyn family wouldnt have been as old then.)I couldnt trigger some events in the game no matter how carefully I played or what walkthrough I followed. I ended up downloading saved games from other people to get past these parts of the game. It lessened the quality of the gameplay for me, to say the least.One thing I loved were Janes mini-games. Sometimes I open the game just to play Skull and Bones.Time Changes: The alarm clock is back. Argh!Voice Acting: BJane is a cute, cultured little English girl. Ethel got on my nerves, appearing out of nowhere and looking down her nose at me. Linda irritated me, her voice and character. I mean, I realize youre depressed, but I flew a thousand miles to help you, so Id appreciate it if youd just answer my questions instead of clamming up, okay, lady?The cockney rhyming slang was extra cool, though.Music: AVery restrained and classical. Chilling and spooky when it needed to be.IGraphics/Video: AJane in particular was weirdly animated. All joints and long legs. I think she was too thin.Other than that, the graphics were the best yet. Bonus points for the smooth animated sequences in between player-controlled action.Technical: CAlong with the problem I had triggering events, I had another glitch in the game. When ordering food from the restaurant, it would appear on a silver platter in my room. But, after that, I could never get other food to be delivered, no matter how long I waited or how many times I asked for it. Every time I lifted the lid, it would always be the first thing I had ordered.Overall, it was a good game, but its definitely not my favorite.", "unixReviewTime": "1175472000"}

The puzzles are hard and you are obliged to play several games with the little girl in the story, Jane, in order to obtain certain tools to proceed. These games within the game did get a bit tedious, but I am was hopelessly slow at Petroglyph Punch and the like. And it took me five tries to gather up 13 ghosts milling around the manor. When something is timed I panic. Im like my cats who vanish if I even look at the door where the vacuum cleaner is kept.The voice acting is very good, and if the British accents arent authentic, so what. The images of the characters are very well done, the gestures and mouth synchronization very natural. Mrs. Drake is particularly good, shes rather like a watered down version of Mrs. Danvers.I could not have finished this game without the help of a walkthrough. The puzzles are hard.

After several unsuccessful attempts, I rebooted my computer with the installation CD in my CD/DVD reader..2. By the fifth reboot, the program began to install. It took over 20 minutes..3. Trying out the software, I activated the video player. It bombed because a file was missing..4. I tried the main program. The blue screen of death appeared, and I had to reboot the computer..5. My Windows 7 OS was destroyed as a consequence. This forced me to reformat the hard drive and re-image my boot partition..6. While my OS was being resurrected, I tried installing the program on a second computer. Immediately the screen went black and everything froze. I hard booted my second computer. Luckily my Windows 7 was OK and nothing was damaged..7. Next day, I went to the Roxio support website, read the fine print, and described the above problems on its form. This is a one-shot deal. The company only allowed one free inquiry with its tech department. Any more, the customer is forced to purchase a service plan..8. The reply was very interesting. Instead of sending a replacement disk or providing me an internet link to download a good copy, the technician needed time to study the case. If I wanted faster or better service, I had to purchase a support plan for a price..This was unreal. The installation disk was bad, and the obvious solution was to replace it. There was no need to study the problem - the solution was brainless. In addition, a paid telephone conversation with a high price technician was not going to cause the defective installation disc to become good...It is too bad that the Amazon.com website does not allow a 0 Star rating.

I gave it an OK rating based on some missing parts in PC-cillin internet security 2004.Now however, it appears as though PC-cillin has the complete package and the memory footprint is still way below the other guys!The 2 biggest features from 2004 are the ability to block URLs by type (i.e., guns, hate, adult) etc.  In the 2004 version you had to manually input each URL that you wanted blocked.  Finally! what a great upgrade.The next most impressive upgrade is the WI-FI alarm for unauthorized uses on your network.  I love it!  Ive often wondered if my network was getting leeched and now I will know for sure.  After a few clicks you can trust or untrust a device and make it so it will not be able to connect.This years product seems to be a little more aggressive in the spyware category so that is also a bonus.I was a very loyal Norton user 2 years ago and now I couldnt be happier I switched.  This product does it all and at about half the use of resources compared to Norton.Well worth the upgrade if you have WI-FI, a network, or just want the latest and greatest.", "unixReviewTime": "1106352000"}

Since the 2003 version I have noticed a significant slowing of my computing but have been unable to identify the source.I ran four different anti-spyware programs, I cleansed the system using all of Nortons utilities and still my computer was painfully slow hanging up on startup and shutdown. I even ran Hijack This and scrupulously followed the tutorial on MajorGeeks. My problems grew progressively worse until I read somewhere that Norton might well be causing my problems.At first I discounted this possibility out of hand - I mean, after all, this was a premier program that had been around for years! Their new CEO is touted as the second coming by all of the business magazines and newspapers. Surely, IT couldnt be the source of my problems. But out of frustration I took Norton off of my computer and VOIL my problems went away! I couldnt believe it. No more computer crashes, no more slovenly performance, no more hanging up on shutdown and interminable startup times.I was then confronted with finding another program to supplant Norton. I searched Cnet and came up with PC-Cillin! This program works great. I does not degrade performance one iota! No hanging up on shutdown or interminable startup times. This program works silently in the background and is literally updated daily in 3 - 5 seconds. I couldnt possibly be more pleased.The firewall in this program seems to work OK - I am unable to appreciate a significant difference from my free version of Zone Alarm.  Spam control implementation is very clumsy, as are most other programs, and it would seem it will be awhile until we get a seamless elegant spam control solution, at least from Trend Micro.  Spyware is certainly no better than Ad-aware.For the life of me I cannot understand how a company as distinguished as Symantec could fritter away all their goodwill and reputation by putting out a program that is quite simply awful.  Im glad to be saying goodbye to Norton and its memory and system resource busting program.At the end of the day the cornerstone of any security suite is going to be the anti-virus program.  PC Cillins anti-virus program is second to none.  The rest of the suite is good, but not necessarily the best and the free programs from Zone Alarm and Ad-Aware are, IMO, better.  My recommendation, go with the PC Cillin anti-virus program and forget the suite.Do yourself a favor. Forget Norton and McAffee. PC-Cillin anti-virus is incomparably better. My computer, for the first time in 18 months, works like it was brand new responding instantaneously to all commands and starting up and shutting down quickly and efficiently.", "unixReviewTime": "1105401600"}

{"overall": 4.0, "reviewerID": "A34VRVI4CSI5RQ", "asin": "B00068IBZW", "reviewText": "I will preface this review by saying that I purchased the 2004 edition just 3 days before the 2005 edition was released, but Trend did me right and gave me a free upgrade. Thats a plus right out of the starting gate.I originally switched to Trend from Norton after having slowdowns and resource shortages. Norton is very large and very slow, but by and large it worked for me. I was hesitant to make the switch, but I decided to do it anyway and see how Trends product works. I have not been disappointed. First off, the memory footprint for this package is about half that of Norton when everything is turned on. For me, thats important - Norton takes up huge amounts of memory and slows the system down, where Trend takes up less room and seems to be a lot faster at execution time.Trend has always had a very fast and very effective antivirus. This latest version is no exception. However, where this package seems to shine most brightly in the antivirus arena is in the timeliness of pattern file updates. Less than a week after the release of a particular email virus, Trend caught it arriving in my inbox and terminated it before it could do anything. To have a pattern for a brand new virus and already be able to handle it is a very, very good thing.The firewall itself is quite effective and it seems to do its job very efficiently. Where it tends to bother people is in the fact that it is a very quiet firewall and it does not notify for every little thing like Norton or ZoneLabs do. This may or may not agree with you, but for me Im content that its working in the background and isnt bothering me with every little thing that happens.The spyware detection feature seems to have come of age, and even after running SpyBot S&D and Ad-Aware, it still found spyware on my system. It did a good job cleaning up and it did everything very fast and efficiently.There are a couple of things I cannot test, as I am on dialup. There are new network protection features that allow remote security administration for systems on the network running Trends suite, and there is also a neat feature that loooks for intruders on wireless networks. Considering that cybersquatting on wireless networks is very common, this is an important feature that should be in all security suites. If you are running a wireless network, this feature will be invaluable.Trend includes a parental control feature in its suite, and it works in a fashion similar to Nortons and ZoneLabs equivalents. You pick your categories to block, and youre done. However, there is a flaw in their implementation - the blocking only seems to work with MS Internet Explorer. So, if you use Mozilla/FireFox or Opera, youre out of luck if you want to use the URL blocking.There is also an antispam feature, but it is not going to prevent spam from arriving in your inbox. Rather, it simply flags questionable messages as spam in the subject at delivery. This can help with sorting and disposal, but it will not keep it from being delivered. In my opinion, spam should never reach the email client if you have an antispam solution in place, so I regard this particular feature as ineffective. I suppose it is better than nothing, though, and many users will find it helpful - I dont. I didnt like Nortons, either, which works the same way.One interesting feature that Trend sports is Outbreak Notification which is used to alert users when a new, high-risk threat is circulating. Users will get a notification when a new high-profile virus is spreading, and that can be helpful if youre relying on manual updates.Trend Micro has put together a winner in their 2005 edition of their PC-Cillin Internet Security suite. It does not lack any major features, and the majority of the things they have included are very good and very effective. There are a few soft spots, but these are not critical to system security, and overall Trend is quickly catching up to the big boys. If you want a fast, small-footprint security solution that competes very competently with the likes of Norton, ZoneLabs and McAfee, Trend is an excellent contender.", "unixReviewTime": "1100736000"}

I know the application can crash your system, and leave you frustrated and vulnerable.  As a public service, Im keeping this review in place for the objective readers to use as one source of information.Fans of the application should not measure their success against this warning.  Your experience does not negate mine; I freely admit the program may work in your circumstances, but all potential buyers should see that PC-Cillin is far from perfect.***Based on c|nets review, I gave this a try, and could not get it to run without spawning a blue screen error (specifically the STOP 0x0000001D and 0x0000000A errors).  This error was traced back to the firewall network driver of the package, and can only be fixed by uninstalling the software.  For those of you with a technical background, the firewall is hooking into the kernel using an outdated technique (AtGuard used to use the same technique).Technical notes: installed via web download and purchase (very easy to do, kudos to Trend Micro), onto a WinXP Pro machine (Dell Dimension 4500).  Plenty of space, definitely enough RAM and a fast enough Pentium 4 CPU.  System was recently patched to SP2.When Trend Micro addresses that issue, I will be able to go over the feature set in more depth.  At this point, however, I cannot recommend the product to anyone who needs a 100% reliable installation the first time.  For that, I would recommend McAfee 9.0.  While it might use more CPU cycles than most, it will install and not crash your PC.If you need antiviral protection *now* and cannot afford to play around with software, skip this current release.Fred", "unixReviewTime": "1100044800"}

Like previous upgrades, there isnt too much of a difference in Excel and Word other than a few things, it is Outlook which has the largest improvements.  I really like the new look as it uses screen real-estate much more efficiently.  The Junk E-Mail filters are better than in previous editions (much better!) and I had no problems working with my previous PST files.  Also, the ability to send busy and free times to people not on Exchange is really nice.However, I do like the changes in Word and Excel, especially as it comes to sharing with other users.  It is nice to have control over what is shared and what isnt shared.  The improved digital signature is a fantastic benefit as well.And Access.  I use Access all the time for my personal databases.  I was really concerned that this might be an upgrade like how 2000 was to 97 where you would need to convert everything over and it wouldnt be backwards compatible.  Thank goodness everything is backwards compatible.  That is a real life saver.

What can we learn from this era? What timeless things are ours to explore in the town of Titusville [in the midwest]?  I found fascination about this time warp, but actually learned nothing unique as I used the tools and ideals brought out from that decade.INITIAL SCORE: 85CHARACTERS:Emily Crandall:  Nancy is out to learn from a friend of a friend what is upsetting this teenager and soon is on a two-part mystery that involves theft of family jewelry and a possible forgery of an estate will.  Emily was definitely distraught as she dealt with insecurities of being financially defunct, her mother passing away a month prior, her odd new guardian, and strange things happening to her [moving framed pictures and voices in her room].  I never got the sense she was insane; just tense. Emily did lose a bit of control at the end when she verbally attacked Nancy; I didnt take too much offense in that, although I probably should have.Jane Willoughby: This is Emilys mothers best friend and she got under my skin right from the start.  Her Minnesota voice was out of place I felt and the strange lingo of Whats cooking? irritated me to the fact that I avoided her if I could.Richard Topham: Spitting image of John OHurley http://images.playbill.com/photo/o/h/ohurleycue200.jpg  and the resident ESP paranormal psychic that continues to practice on the grounds.  He was close colleagues with Josiah Crowley, the eccentric rich man who owned the Lilac Inn and is now the direct benefactor of the will that is now being contested.  I thought it a little arrogant to have him infer I needed to pass a test in order to converse with him, but I also found it fascinating since I aced it!Jim Archer: This banker was my #1 suspect, because there was something about his financial dealings he wont making clear to me and he seemed friendly in a bizarre way.Carson Drew/Bess:  This was the most grown up I have ever heard from Nancys dad as compared to the later versions where he sounds less gruff and slightly younger in his views. Bess was the same delight as always.CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 84SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:Totally different from any of the other ND adventures which is quite obvious. I didnt say it was an excellent score necessarily, but I give HER points for bringing out the eras style.  Graphics were decent, though learned nothing new about the era except perhaps the roadster and black/white photos of the early 20th century after the first World war.  Sound effects and detail of the ladder being sprung in the barn were fantastic.  The businesses and residents of Titusville were hugely entertaining as you delivered telegrams in the adventure. I loved Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farms, hahaCUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 86PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: The golf game was strangely not as fun as I would have imaged, although I loved the golfball color challenge. Also not as enjoyable as I thought was the conversation cue ESP test. It took me a long time to integrate the sentences Richard spoke with the traditional card symbols. The Hobo puzzle was easy and okay. I like the test in the parlor involving the slider Shakespeare characters.CUMUL SCORE: Even = 86ADVENTURE ENDING: I wasnt totally compelled with the plotline, but I wouldnt necessarily say I was bored neither. Thank God that the telegrams werent a required evil the entire time as that would have made the game extremely tedious.CUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 87* PART 2 *I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were totake weeks! Well, it took me three days [9 hours] and I gave myself aDetective Score Of : 75My Strong Points: The games were completed at a steady pace and I rarely needed help from the walkthrough although I had trouble finding out where to continue the adventure after being derailed mentally sometimes.My Weak Points: I did not guess the culprit!!!  I didnt think I was that off-base, but I WAS so I have to give HER a bit of credit for stumping me [something they hadnt done in the last seven adventures thus far].OVERALL GAME SCORE: 87 + 75/ 2 = 81 [ B - ]BOTTOMLINE: Cracking the Top Ten says a lot for a Franchise that is pushing to get its first A level type game, but at least we know that HER is trying to stretch its boundaries.

{"overall": 4.0, "reviewerID": "A3PD6NG6XL336W", "asin": "B0009X6QJM", "reviewText": "Secret of the Old Clock is probably among the most unique Nancy Drew games. This game was released in 2005, and in honor of her 75th anniversary, this game was released. Its title comes from the first Nancy Drew book ever published, and the story itself is a mix of the first four Nancy Drew books ever published (The Secret of the Old Clock, The Hidden Staircase, The Bungalow Mystery, and The Mystery at Lilac Inn). To add to the feeling of authenticity, Secret of the Old Clock takes place in 1930, the year that the book was published.In this game, a young woman named Emily Crandall has asked Nancy to drive out to her Lilac Inn to meet her, saying shed like her to do her a favor. This takes Nancy by surprise, as she doesnt really know Emily aside from their mutual friend Helen Corning. However, thoughtful as she is, Nancy accepts.When Nancy drives out to the Inn, she meets Emilys guardian Jane Willoughby, who is legally responsible for Emily now that Gloria Crandall (her mother) has passed away (her father died in battle years ago). Jane tells Nancy that Emily has been acting strangely, but Nancy dismisses this, thinking that shes probably full of grief and stress after losing her mom and trying to run the inn on her own.Nancy goes upstairs to meet with Emily in her room. Emily tells Nancy that shed like her to lock her mothers jewelry up in a safe, to keep it safe from all of the weird things that have been happening around the Inn lately. Nancys curiosity gets going about these weird things, but she has little time to ask before the stove in the kitchen ignites!Nancy, Emily, and Jane all run out to escape the fire. The fire department arrives in time to save the Lilac Inn, but not in time to save the stove. With the stove gone, the Lilac Inn will no longer be able to serve its famous pies, meaning it could have to shut down for good. Not only that, but the priceless jewelry was stolen in the midst of it all!All of the financial trouble that was happening in the 30s (the game takes place right before the Great Depression) and lack of a stove makes Emily blurt out that she wishes Josiah Crowley - a rich old man whod recently passed away - had left her money in his will like he said he would. When Nancy asks about this, she learns that Mr. Crowley had promised hed leave various people who he cared about money when he died, but when his will was found, they were left nothing and all of his belongings went to an ESP expert named Richard Tompham.Just what happened to the jewelry? Why did the stove ignite? Is the will that was found the true will of Josiah Crowley? If so, why would a sweet old man like him break his promises? Nancys now determined to find out the truth by solving her first case...The storyline is pretty strong, and actually flowed very impressively, which I imagine would be hard to do when combining *four* stories into one. The mystery does eventually branch off into two or three different cases in and of itself, but its actually all weaved together rather nicely by the end. The ending was very good, and I really cant complain about how things turned out at all.I rather liked being able to explore and sneak around the Lilac Inn, as well as a few other places, like Josiah Crowleys old house (now inhabited by Topham) and the towns bank. This is also the first game to use the driving feature, which gives the player the ability to drive around Titusville (the name of the city the games taking place in) by controlling the car from an areal view with their mouse. I had mixed feelings about the driving feature, as it does get hard to control and its possible to lose the game if a flat tire isnt properly taken care of.  Still, it was also a cute little feature that was fun to include in a game. I do miss seeing everything from Nancys perspective, though...The puzzles were fun, and I liked the majority of them, but some of them were pretty hard to get through and felt like they rewarded little. The golfing challenge in particular was extremely hard to get through, and Id say I spent at least a good half hour trying to win that section of the game alone. The sewing challenge was also pretty hard the first time around, but I felt it was easier once I got the hang of it.Since the game does take place in 1930, there are lots of modern luxuries that were in previous games that did not appear in this game. For example, Nancy doesnt have a cell phone, and has to drive back to the Lilac Inn to use the coin phone on the porch whenever she wants to make a call. The phone friends in this game were nice, and this is the first (and so far, only) game in which Nancy has the ability to call her dad for hints and insight into the case. I really liked having Carson Drew in the game, and Im hoping he makes his second appearance soon.Speaking of the coin phone - thats another new feature employed in this game. This is the first game to employ the use of money, and Nancy must pay to get various tasks done (i.e. paying for more gas, buying things for other people, etc.). Its possible to run low on money, but Nancy can also drive around town delivering telegrams in exchange for some money. Delivering telegrams can get tedious at times, but the small conversations that are always sparked between Nancy and the person shes delivering the telegram to always brought about some comedic relief. Some of them were actually pretty funny.The characters were well-integrated, and all seemed to have good reason to be the culprit. I wasnt sure who necessarily would be the culprit at the end, but there was enough to make me suspect everybody at times (even Emily). The culprit choice was actually rather surprising, and employed a move thatd never been used before when explaining the culprits motive. While some may have their doubts about this, I felt it was rather nicely written into the story and made the game even more unique.The suspects in this game include Emily Crandall, a 17-year-old orphaned girl who seems to have been losing her marbles ever since her mother died and feels like shes incapable of running Lilac Inn. Jane Willoughby was Gloria Crandalls best friend from years ago, and is currently acting as Emilys guardian until she turns 18; shes trying to convince Emily to sell the Inn thinking that she should take advantage of her youth while she still has it. Jim Archer is Emilys banker who seems to be a little evasive about the situations going on at the Lilac Inn, and also thinks Emily should sell the Inn before the bills start getting too high. Richard Topham is Josiah Crowleys former ESP trainer whos residing in Josiahs old house, whos inherited all of Crowleys belongings and views the Crandalls and Mr. Archer as selfish people who only loved Josiah because he had a lot of money.Secret of the Old Clock has a rather nice selection of music. None of it was my own personal cup of tea, because I prefer scarier music. The game does feature some nice 30s music, though. All of it complimented the game itself, and I think that the soundtrack really couldnt get much better than it already is.Is Secret of the Old Clock as strong of a game as most of the classic 13 Nancy Drew games? No. I do miss seeing everything from Nancys perspective, and some of the puzzles and challenges were very hard and frustrating. However, is it a bad game? Most definitely not! The story is wonderful, and I really liked the cast. It still features more first person exploration than a lot of the more recent games do, and it still holds the feel-good classic Nancy Drew game feeling that the first 13 games had. While this wouldnt be my top recommendation for a Nancy Drew game, itd definitely still be high up in my gaming recommendations, and should be played by anybody who wants to play all of the good Nancy Drew games or those who want to take a blast into the past and catch a cunning criminal by finding out the secret surrounding the old clock. :) 4 stars for this gem of a game!", "unixReviewTime": "1310601600"}

Although its not my favorite it is still a good game and great for people new to the series. Im going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.PLOT - 4/5: Nancy is invited to the Lilac Inn by an acquaintance of hers named Emily Crandall. Emilys mother recently died so Emilys guardian, Jane, is staying with her until she turns 18. She invited Nancy because strange things have been happening at the Inn, and the adventure begins right when Nancy arrives as shes confronted by a mystery including stolen jewels, missing wills, exploding kitchens and plenty of excitement. I liked the plot because it was very straightfoward - find out whos behind whats been happening to the Inn. It does a pretty good job of keeping the player interested. Another thing I liked is that I felt like everything that I was doing was connected to the plot and had a purpose. The plot isnt as complicated as some of the other ND titles, but for a beginner its a good introduction to how these games work.CHARACTERS - 3/5: The characters are alright in this game - not very memorable. Out of the main characters, though, my favorite would have to be Jane. She was the only one with interesting things to say, and I really liked her accent. As for the rest - Emily was nice, a little boring, though, Topham was definitely fishy, and the banker, Jim Archer, was so forgettable that I forgot his name and actually just had to look it up on Wikipedia. The main characters are just average. But my favorite characters were Bess and George, as always, and the telephone operator. I kept spending all my money on the pay phone talking to them cause they were so amusing. Plus the people in town were also fun to talk to.SETTING - 5/5: This is the only Nancy Drew game set in the 30s (as a tribute to the books). Her Interactive totally aced the 30s feeling, I really felt I was there. The music was great, real swingy and jazz like. And driving around Nancys blue roadster was also lots of fun. I had to have delivered like 50 telegrams throughout the game just so I could drive around in it. The setting is just really well done.PUZZLES - 4.5/5: The puzzles in this game arent very hard. Im not very good at puzzles, but I managed to figure out most of these on my own, which says alot. I only used a walkthrough on a couple of really complicated ones. A lot of other people had trouble with the mini golf game, but I dont remember that one giving me trouble. The only one I really hated was fishing. It took me like forever to figure it out, but once I looked it up I realized Id been doing it all wrong. But for the most part the puzzles were all fun and easy, which I really liked because I never felt frustrated or bored while I was doing them.IS IT CHALLENGING?: Not really. On a scale of 1 to 5 Id give it a 3, mabye even a 2 if youre really good at puzzles. But like Ive said before, this is a good game for first-timers.ENDING - 5/5: I thought the ending was really great. I was a bit surprised by the culprit, which is good, and their motive was good. Everything made sense and there were no loose ends. Catching the culprit was also alot of fun once I got the hang of it. The ending isnt extremely thrilling or scary or anything, but it makes alot of sense with the plot, thats why I thought it was so good.FINAL SCORE:Plot - 4Characters - 3Setting - 5Puzzles - 4.5Challenge - 3Ending - 5= 24.5 divided by 6 = 4.08 rounded to 4 stars", "unixReviewTime": "1283817600"}

This is the only Nancy Drew game that takes place in the past- in the 1930s.  Its also probably the easiest of the Nancy Drew games Ive played.  Nancy undertakes to help her orphaned friend Emily, who has inherited her mothers inn, and fallen into a deep state of melancholy.  The inn has been experiencing strange accidents, and its up to Nancy to figure them out.  The puzzles in this game were a bit easier than the standard Nancy Drew fare.  Also, there werent as many locations to investigate as some other ND games.  In particular, theres very little to do in the inn, and one of the things ND games do so well is to set up spooky, old, searchable houses.

Then this game came out to become one of my least favorites.Story-You are visiting a friend of a friend who owns an inn/restaurant.  She says that the reason she invited you over was for you to take some jewels back with you to put into your safe at home.  Before you can take them, however, they are stolen.  Whoo.  Thrills and chills.  This is the story.  Finding stolen jewels.  Thats it.  And you never actually find them because during the game Nancy becomes distracted from her task to find another item which hasnt even been stolen!  This item is a will, by the way.Graphics-They were okay.  Thankfully, HERinteractive didnt try to put this game in black-and-white, but the backgrounds actually seemed worse to me than the others have.  Maybe because I just wasnt enjoying anything else, this seemed bad.  The characters look pretty good, though.  Oh!  But some of the locations you go (Phelps Print Shop, Tubbys Telegram Office, etc.) are just black-and-white snapshots.  Why didnt HER make them good, real locations?!?!Sound-This is, like, 40s music.  Its not bad, and it definitely goes with the story.Gameplay-There is one big change in gameplay.  You get to drive around in your car.  You can use the arrow keys or you can lead with the mouse, but you visit almost everywhere by car.  Also, no cell phone (its 80 years ago, people!) so you have to give up money to use the pay phone to call your dad or Bess and George.  Thats another thing.  You have to earn money in this game because you have to pay for stuff.  You have to get a job to earn money.  Its really not that bad, but I thought there were better ways to have let you make money.  First Person and point-and-click features are the same, though.Fun-No its not.  Its fun the first time through to figure out who the culprit is, but after that, the only replay value is to play mini golf.  I do replay it sometimes but not to the extent of the other games.Length-Playing it straight through takes about 9-10 hours.  It took me about a week to finish this game the first time.  Its an OK length, but after the last game I was expecting more.HERinteractive really regressed in this game.  I have to admit, though, the older fans of Nancy Drew will like this game, and some might find it a good way to start the series, but I think that die-hard fans should get this game only for $10 or cheaper while others should just skip this game for now.", "unixReviewTime": "1260921600"}

Things are graded A-F, just like school.The Crime: CIts 1930, and Nancy stops by the home of Emily Crandall to check on her. The girl has recently lost her mother, and now has said she is seeing things. She asks Nancy to put her mothers jewels in a safe, but before Nancy can do so, an explosion occurrs! The jewelry is stolen and Nancy Drew begins her first case.Also on the docket is finding out what happened to Josiah Crowley, a local eccentric who had promised to leave money to Emily. The Depression is starting and the young girl can use all the help she can get!Suspects include Emilys guardian Jane W., kind banker Mr. Archer, and psychic Richard Topham (who also happens to be Josiahs sole heir).My thought on this was that the crime was trying too hard. It left me feeling indifferent.Puzzles: BThe look and feel of the puzzles was great. My favorite one was the number/symbol game in the carriage house. I agonized over it, but I loved it. Ultimately, though, there didnt seem to be a lot of puzzles in this game at all. Not as many as previous games.Gameplay: BThis game is more a fetch-and-carry than a mystery. The mystery tends to get lost while Nancy spends most of her time running errands for people around town. Everybody has a line like, Oh, I would love to do that for you, Nancy, but first I have to... and of course Nancy volunteers. This happens over and over. Even Nancy comments to Bess, You wouldnt believe what I had to go through...You drive Nancys roadster, which I liked, deliver telegrams for extra money (which I liked, but got tedious after a while), explore hidden passages, fish the local waterhole, and play mini-golf.One thing I didnt like was that the mini-golf was disconnected from the game. In CUR, Janes games had to be won at some point in order to get something. In CLK, the mini-golf is obviously there only an extra.HI did a good time integrating the time period and the Great Depression into the game without hitting us over the head with it. I really liked how you could experience the town and the townspeople, even though you could only actually enter a few locations (they used black-and-white period pictures to show you the rest).There are no spooky moments, no suspense, and no thrills and chills here at all. The closest you come is when Nancy scares herself in the hidden passage.This is the shortest Nancy Drew game ever made, with the exception of SCK. I finished in 7 hours, and that is unlike me. I was disappointed; I expect more bang for my $20.Time Changes: None. This all takes place in a single day.Voice Acting: BThe voices all kind of rolled off me. They were wonderfully done, but they were missing some oomph. Emily seems sad and delicate, Jane is blowsy, Richard is a slick public speaker-type, and Mr. Archer is a nice guy.Carson Drew was excellent and is the reason for the B. Hes perfect: wise, patient, kind, loving. Nancys relationship with him is spelled out in the first phone call - they love each other, and he thinks shes a smart cookie. Perfect.The people who stood out to me were the bit players - Mrs. Jakowski, good-time-girl and local phone operator, and Mrs. OShea, patroness of the orphanage.Music: BPeriod, and very nice, but again, I was sort of indifferent. I did find myself nodding my head to the jazzy ragtime that plays in The Lilac Inns entrance hall.Graphics/Video: AThe best yet, of course. One gripe I do have is why are all the slim girls so frightening? Jane in CUR and Emily in this game are scarily thin. If you look at Emilys feet as she sits in the window seat, you can tell that the size of her legs and feet is so small as to be almost impossible. Why cant HI do a skinny girl without her being out of proportion?Technical: APerfectly perfect.Overall, I think this one is neat and entertaining, a great way to pass a few hours, but it was lacking The Wow Factor for me. I just wasnt dazzled by what I saw like I have been in the past.If you love Nancy Drew, this ones for you. Play it and have a good time.

{"overall": 4.0, "reviewerID": "A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB", "asin": "B0009X6QJM", "reviewText": "Nancy Drew turns 75 this year, and shes still got her youthful sense of sleuthing... in fact, shes as keen as when she first came out in 1930. In honour of Nancys 75th birthday, Her Interactive has set Nancys newest mystery Secret of the Old Clock in 1930s America before the start of the depression. Nancy drives a sporty blue roadster, listens to jazz records, and talks nervously of the possible Depression, while using expressions such as keen, horsefeathers and the bees knees. Nancys first mystery (based on her first two books Secret of the Old Clock and Mystery at Lilac Inn) finds her investigating mysterious happenings at the Lilac Inn. The inn is run by seventeen-year-old orphaned Emily, whose mother died recently, and her guardian Jane Willoughby, but Emily has asked Nancy to come help her. It turns out that shes been hearing things, and various accidents have occurred. The plot quickly thickens, leaving Nancy to puzzle out an eccentric millionaire and a forged will that has high stakes for all involved: Jim Archer, banker on the edge of ruin, Richard Topham, clairvoyant who lives in the deceased millionaires house, Emily and her guardian.As with previous titles, a good deal of puzzle solving is chore related, of the I scratch your back, you scratch mine mentality. This means that Nancy must complete chores for other characters before she can receive the necessary information (or inventory) to proceed. Some of these are easier than others: arranging pies, catching a 19-inch largemouth bass, finding toys for a childrens orphanage, picking up raffle tickets, and sewing a dress (fiendishly hard, and Im a cross-stitcher!). This game sees the addition of two new features, both of which I found unnecessarily frustrating: Nancys blue roadster, which must be filled up with gas and keeping an eye out for flat tires, and money, which Nancy must spend to solve puzzles (miniature golf, purchasing items, etc.). Nancys initial $3.50 flies by as you constantly refill your gas tank and spend money to purchase items, and the only way to get more money is by delivering telegrams. This is problematic for two reasons: one, your customers dont tip (although there are some very funny characters and in-jokes), and two, you spend more money in gas delivering them than you earn.Thats not to say that Secret of the Old Clock doesnt have any redeeming features. Clearly, a great deal of historical research went into the creation of the game, from the 1930s slang to the black-and-white photos that represent Titusvilles shops, to the Art Deco motifs in the Lilac Inn and the bank. There seems to be much less interaction with characters: you hardly ever see Emily, chat once or twice with Jane and Topham and Jim Archer. The game seemed shorter (and easier) than other titles in the series, but was a welcome departure in terms of style and feel. A special note here for the games wonderful atmospheric music: a variety of authentic big band swing with muted horns, mixed with creepy music at key points, really brings the player into the 1930s. One gripe: the character sprites seemed very low-resolution and blurry, and it wasnt just my monitor. A shame, since so much care was taken on backgrounds and animations.Overall, this is a welcome addition to the Nancy Drew series and another fine accomplishment for Her Interactive, one of the most innovative and dedicated gaming companies around.

Before I say anything more, I think it important to add that I am 35 years old - so, take it from me, these games are great fun for ANYONE over the age of about 10!This particular game is set in the 1930s (the depression era), and is about a young girl whose mother recently passed away - leaving her a bed & breakfast/bakery to run.  She did, however, write her friend before passing, asking her to come & help her 17 year old daughter if something should happen to her - and her friend rushed right over, trying to help out, but knowing nothing of the business.Strange things started happening at the inn at about this time, and both the young girl & her guardian are convinced that she is having a nervous breakdown - that its all in her head.  Especially since not only is she grieving the loss of her mother, but they are running out of money.  An elderly neighbor (who was quite rich) had promised to leave them plenty of money in his will - but when he died, it looked as though he left all of his money & estate to a man who supposedly taught mind reading & esp.In comes Nancy Drew...  Is the will originally found the ONLY one?  Could it be a forgery?  And what of all the strange noises & happenings at the inn?  Whos behind them, or are they really all in the teenagers mind?  These are the questions youll have to answer while playing teen detective.I found several differences between this game & the other Nancy Drew games Ive played to date.  First, the graphics are better - in fact they are just as good as some of the more high-tech games Ive played.  Second, you actually get to drive a car (but be sure to watch out for potholes)!  Last, there was much more ground to cover - which I really liked - so you get to see a lot of the town, and speak with several people (rather than just being confined to a house, and only talking to 1 or 2 others).  Oh, theres one more difference...  You actually have to earn money in this game - to pay for gas, car repairs, games & other necessary items.Overall, I think this game is a must have for anyone who enjoys (or had enjoyed) the Nancy Drew series.  One of the great assets of these games is that they allow you to choose a difficulty level - but, I must warn all you other adults out there, if you havent played many ND games (or even if you have!), you may want to choose the junior level.  This will allow you to get more hints if you need them - and if you dont, you just dont ask for them - as its the number of hints that will change based on the level you choose to play at.Another 2 thumbs up for the creators of Nancy Drew!!!", "unixReviewTime": "1125014400"}

Definitely worth $20. Im going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.PLOT - 5/5: Nancy is invited by socialite Lori Girard to ride West on a historic train in hopes of solving a centuries old mystery. Basically, a rich man named Jake Hurley supposedly left a huge treasure somewhere, only nobody has ever been able to put together all of the clues he left and find it - thats where you, as Nancy, come in. Cause she can solve anything, right? Right. This is a commonly used plot in the ND series, but it was very well executed by Her Interactive. There is the perfect balance of mystery, romance, excitement, history, a bit of spookiness, humor - just about everything you could ask for. A good Nancy Drew game is nothing without a good plot, and this plot ranks up there among the best!CHARACTERS - 5/5: The characters in this game are a huge improvement over the lackluster characters in SOTOC #12. Each one has their own personality and theyre all fun to interact with. Lori Girard is a ditsy socialite whos desperate for attention, Charleena Purcell is a big time romance writer who we met in Secret of Shadow Ranch (Shes a little annoying IMO), John Grey is the host of ghost chaser show, but his character doesnt really do anything, Tino Balducci is a hot-shot detective who got his big break when he just happened to be in the right place at the right time, and Frank and Joe Hardy are, as always, fun to talk to and very helpful. My favorite character in this game was Fatima from the gift shop - she was soo funny! Its FATIMA, with an F, none of that freaky PH stuff! Hahahahaah!SETTING - 5/5: The train was very beautiful. Very antique and a bit creepy at times, it fit the time period when it was built perfectly. All of the train cars were really well done. The gift shop and Copper Gorge was nice, too. The morgue was bit creepy - as it should be, but there wasnt much to explore there. And the desert at the end was very life-like. You could tell that a lot of work was put into this game. I only wish that there was more to explore at Copper Gorge, but we cant have everything I guess.PUZZLES - 4.5/5: The puzzles in this game were a lot harder than the last one. Which is good, cause the last game was pretty easy. Some of the puzzles were really easy and repetitive (all those pipes!), and some were really complicated. Plus there were some puzzles that were really simple but just hard to do. It was a good balance between easy and hard. I used a walkthrough for this game a lot more than the last game, because some of the puzzles (like those dolls) were just too confusing for me. But overall the puzzles were really good!IS IT CHALLENGING?: Yes, especially the first time you play it. On a scale of 1 to 5, Id give it a 4, but if youre really good at puzzles it might not be so hard for you.ENDING - 5/5: Id say that the maze at the end is pretty easy, but the memorizing part (for me, at least) was challenging. I died more than a few times trying to figure it out. But the culprit was really unexpected and had an interesting motive. The escape at the end was like a roller coaster, I just thought it was awesome! Very well done!Final Score:Plot: 5Characters: 5Setting: 5Puzzles: 4.5Challenge: 4Ending: 5= 28.5 divided by 6 = 4.75 rounded to 5 stars", "unixReviewTime": "1283817600"}

Actually in one little part of the game you get to play as Frank Hardy.  You can see the brothers in the game, but you shouldnt even put them on the possible suspects, because they are your allies.  After all, they are the ones who invited you onto the train to help with the mystery.Story-Lori Girard (think Paris Hilton) has invited several people on a train ride to help her find out what happened to the man who originally owned the train.  One day, he suddenly disappeared and his engineer was found on the deserted train, dead.  Suddenly, after Lori explains this and more to you and the other people, the lights go out, and Lori disappears!  Looks like finding what happened to the original owner of the train is on hold.  Now you need to find out what happened to Lori!Graphics-They are better, but just by a little, like usual.  The characters are a little better.  The train cars are really drawn in detail, though.Sound-Not that great music, but its not THAT bad.  Its just not memorable.  The voice acting is pretty good, the actors/actresses actually sound like they are trying to sound like the characters they are portraying.Gameplay-Everything is exactly the same except your cell phone has a camera feature to let you take pictures.  I thought that was a fun addition.Fun-Everything is much more fun that the last game.  This game isnt as fun as some of the other games in the series, but it is definitely a big step in the right direction!Length-The first time I played this game, I used a walkthrough (which I DO NOT usually do) and it took me 13 hours to complete.

The treasure, so to speak, was completely out of the park.  There had been nothing to indicate leading up to it that this was what we were seeking.

Jake had built a custom train that he and his wife Camille traveled on, but after Camilles mysterious, sudden death aboard the train, Jake, too, disappeared, the train found abandoned with the engineer dead at the wheel. The ghost train has been restored by socialite Lori Girard, who has invited several celebrities on the maiden voyage: television ghost hunter John Grey, famous historical romance novelist Charleena Purcell, hotshot detective Tino Balducci, Frank and Joe Hardy, and Nancy, of course. Soon after the train heads towards Copper Gorge, Lori disappears and its up to Nancy to find out what happened to her. Along the way, clues to Camilles untimely death and Jakes legendary mine surface.The modeling of the train cars is a pleasant departure from previous ND games. Scenery whips by outside the train windows, and you have to hop from train car to train car as the ground speeds by underneath. Chandeliers sway from the motion of the train. There is loving attention to detail in each room: period photographs, stitched samplers, and aged sheet music all create a believable atmosphere. In addition to the train, Nancy has the chance to disembark and explore Copper Gorge, Colorado.There are several gameplay additions from previous ND games, including Nancys camera cell phone and Frank and Joe Hardy (who have a relatively small role, although you do get to play as the Hardy Boys at one point in the game). Puzzles are creative, with some HerInteractive standards such as the make your own sandwich standby, but others (such as a music-related puzzle) were a welcome breath of fresh air that built on HerInteractives solid reputation as a producer of non-violent, girl-friendly games that emphasize creative problem solving. Clues are just obvious enough without giving away answers, strategically placed and cleverly hidden.Overall, I thought the ending a bit weak (too many loose ends for my taste), and the much-hyped Hardy Boys underutilized, but the solid gameplay and gorgeous graphics more than make up for it.

These graphics are definitely on par with the likes of Myst, and other adventure games - although you do have to play for a little while before you get to enjoy them...This Nancy Drew game is about a young rich girl who had her father restore an old train back to working condition.  There are many rumors surrounding this train - especially since the original owner wound up missing in the mid 1800s, and his engineer was found still in the train, in the middle of the desert, dead...  On top of this, the owners wife had died on the train at an earlier date, so many people thought it was haunted.The reason the young girl had wanted the train restored was because story had it that Jack Hurley (the original owner), had found gold in a mine - and that the directions to find this mine were all hidden inside the train.  She wanted this treasure, and invited several people (including Nancy and the Hardy boys) to help solve the mysteries, and find the mine.This is one of those games that ropes you in.  In fact, I couldnt stop playing it!!!I think its important for you to know that I am 36 years old - a testament to the fact that these games are great for teens and adults alike!!!Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed (or is enjoying) the Nancy Drew Mystery series.

Just a note of caution though - Id suggest you choose the junior detective regardless of your age, as there are several areas where its too easy to become stuck, and if you choose this level, you have the benefit of a few more hints and the task journal - both big helps when you find yourself unable to move on...", "unixReviewTime": "1134259200"}

This is due to accuracy problems and the competitive landscape. Since S&T 2005 was released, the big news in map software is Googles launch of Google Earth, which includes over twelve (12) terabytes of satellite data. Microsoft has responded with a less robust product, MSN Virtual Earth, which has some connectivity with Streets and Trips 2006.The latest release of S&T 2006 has the same fast, robust interface as previous versions and some new features such as a night mode (which itself is of dubious value). However, my limited testing has uncovered glaring errors in the map data. Specifically, the NYC subway system depiction has several erroneous or omitted subway stops in Manhattan alone. While this may seem trivial, the NYC subway is the busiest in the United States. Moreover, some of the errors are grossly inaccurate, such as showing a B/Q Subway stop at Lexington and 63rd. Neither line passes within a half mile (quite a long distance in Manhattan) of this location. Other less egregious errors include an omission of a 28th street stop on the 1/9 train.There has always been a poor representation of the public transportation system in Streets and Trips, severely limiting its utility for urban users of the software. The Chicago Transportation authority (CTA), for example, has online point-to-point directions that include walking, buses and subway. S&T has no such feature, nor does it even have walking directions that overlook one-way streets. At least there should be plug-ins for different metropolitan areas, if not including built-in overlays of train and subway infrastructure that appear with a simple toggle. Even worse, many of the subway stops that are correctly positioned in Streets and Trips do not show at magnification levels that clearly depict stops that are farther from the viewing center of the map. Such visual anomalies can cause much confusion for users. This problem appears to be worse than in previous versions.My major complaint with earlier editions of Streets and Trips was that it didnt integrate with other location-specific data sources, such as Citysearch, Craigslist or metropolitan traffic web sites. Microsofts integration with MSN Virtual Earth is a nice start. However, the map quality and features are below that of Googles offering. Moreover, it uses a less robust web interface, which [the lack of] is the main reason users like Street and Trips in the first place.Streets and Trips 2006 is still the fastest map software with the smoothest interface. However, Microsoft needs better quality control and bug reporting. Longer-term, Microsoft needs to create an ecosystem around Streets and Trips with various entertainment, travel and transportation data sources included in a real-time format. Otherwise, Google is going to drive it off the market.Pros*Speed*Some interactivity with MSN Virtual Earth*No advertisementsCons*Lack of integration with third-party data*No available data for other continents*No map or point-of-interest updates*Quality control and difficult bug reporting*No plug-ins*No bookmarks*Lacking non-driving (cycling, walking) maps and public transit grids", "unixReviewTime": "1131667200"}

There are innumerable examples of this dumbing down and simpifying which only serves to confuse.The good news: The GPS functionality has been vastly improved with voice and large visual prompts which make using the program in an automobile MUCH MUCH easier.

I am familiar with the Delorme product and the Garmin product and Streets and Trips blows them both away - no contest. Instantaneous panning, zooming in and zooming out, outstanding routing software, and a plethora of other features makes Streets and Trips, by far, my favorite mapping software.One problem I had, and hopefully this will help others who might encounter the same problem: Downloading the software into your computer does NOT automatically load the drivers for the GPS locator device! This must be done separately with the Setup disk when you first attach the locator device. Should you fail to put the Setup disk in and let your computer find the driver automatically ON THAT DISK, then your program will not recognize the locator! I wasted quite a bit of time trying to figure out what was wrong. If you dont add the drivers manually your device manager will automatically load drivers that will not be recognized by the program! I had to go into my Device Manager and uninstall the drivers that were added and then manually install the MS drivers for the GPS locator. Not an insurmountable problem, but it does require a bit of experience with computers.The included driver software turns your USB port into a pseudo-serial communication port enabling the software to recognize the locator (only serial ports are recognized by the software). The software will not recognize the locator UNLESS it is attached to a serial (or in this case pseudo-serial) communications port. So be careful and follow the installation instructions closely. The locator is made by Pharos GPS and if you have any installation problems go to their web site for further instructions.I heartily recommend this product however be aware of the minor software and driver glitches Ive described above.

This program offers a truly affordable GPS guidance system for nearly all consumers without having to go to the expensive Garmin or Magellan systems.  If you find yourself traveling to points unknown I cannot imagine a better solution for getting around than this product in conjunction with your notebook.A few comments about the Streets and Trips mapping software. I am familiar with the Delorme product and the Garmin product and Streets and Trips blows them both away - no contest. Instantaneous panning, zooming in and zooming out, outstanding routing software, and a plethora of other features makes Streets and Trips, by far, my favorite mapping software.One problem I had, and hopefully this will help others who might encounter the same problem: Downloading the software into your computer does NOT automatically load the drivers for the GPS locator device!  This must be done separately with the Setup disk when you first attach the locator device. Should you fail to put the Setup disk in and let your computer find the driver automatically ON THAT DISK, then your program will not recognize the locator!  I wasted quite a bit of time trying to figure out what was wrong.  If you dont add the drivers manually your device manager will automatically load drivers that will not be recognized by the program!  I had to go into my Device Manager and uninstall the drivers that were added and then manually install the MS drivers for the GPS locator.  Not an insurmountable problem, but it does require a bit of experience with computers.The included driver software turns your USB port into a pseudo-serial communication port enabling the software to recognize the locator (only serial ports are recognized by the software).  The software will not recognize the locator UNLESS it is attached to a serial (or in this case pseudo-serial) communications port. So be careful and follow the installation instructions closely. The locator is made by Pharos GPS and if you have any installation problems go to their web site for further instructions.I heartily recommend this product however be aware of the minor software and driver glitches Ive described above.  All in all, I think you will be VERY pleased.", "unixReviewTime": "1130457600"}

First off, it is not as intuitive as when I try to do directions on Google Maps.For instance, when I have pushpins set on a map, I should be able to simply right-click and select another pinpoint as a destination.  Or at the very least click and drag one pushpin to another to get directions.  Instead if you drag a pushpin, it gets move yet still retains the address of its original position!!!  Even thought its obviously a different location.  I cant for the life of me figure out why they would even allow dragging if the information isnt going to be updated.  That type of drag serves no useful purpose whatsoever.It kind of shocks me that the biggest software company on the planet cant figure out how to make things intuitive.  You would think theyd have the best product out there.  But they dont.  Streets and Trips is useful for getting a map when you dont have an internet connection but if you do, its easier to make a map from Google and print it to PDF which you can have onscreen while youre driving.With GPS its pretty good for navigation but thats it.", "unixReviewTime": "1183766400"}

I decided after riding in my moms Toyota Sienna that her GPS system was excellent. Keep in mind, she had a high dollar system so I expected it to be much better then anything I would buy that is portable.I bought Streets and Trips 2006 at my local best buy store for $89, it came with the GPS locator. I had my laptop in the car with me so I installed the software and it started to work immediatly, I was impressed that it pinpointed my location as quickly as it did. I typed in my home address and bingo, it routed me onto the interstate and home. That part worked perfectly. I will say that on the way home on I-40 they shifted the road for road construction, the system was so accurate there that it kept saying OFF ROUTE because the lanes were temp. shifted about 30 feet onto the shoulder, that was pretty cool. Overall with this I was impressed.What I was not impressed with was: I live on a major road, about 1.5 miles behind my place is a wal-mart with several roads that go to it. When I used the GPS system to navigate me to the store it tried to route me on a 10 mile trip, apparently some of the roads I normally take were not in the map database. In fact there was a total of 3 missing roads in this one 1.5 mile area that had been in Knoxville since I moved here 4 years ago. These are not brand new roads, they are at minimum 4 years old and SHOULD be in the map database.Other issues I have with the software include the Pocket PC piece. While the pocket PC does display the maps perfectly it will not create routes for you. Additionally if you try to hook the GPS locator up to your pocket pc you will find that it does not ROUTE or NAVIGATE you. The GPS locator simply shows you on the map where you are, in my case it was about 1/4 mile off, this was a  huge problem for me. The reason I bought it was so I could put my pocket pc in my truck and use that as my navigation system. Not so, it doesnt speak, it doesnt route, it doesnt navigate. Its just a picture with a moving dot that represesnts your current position.Speaking of, speaking. The program does offer verbal turn by turn guidance, however do NOT expect this program to announce the names of the streets you are to turn on. It simply says TURN LEFT, I would have liked it to say TURN LEFT ON MAIN STREET for example.North, south, east or west??? One more thing I dont like about this program is lack of detail in directions. I punched in to go from work to home and it routed me via interstates. When I left work and neared the on-ramp it said TURN RIGHT in .3 miles, the screen showed TURN RIGHT ON I-40, it didnt tell me east or west. Then on my way home I take the I-75 split, it said STAY RIGHT but it didnt display if I needed I-75 North or south. Had construction been going on and lanes shifted, etc I would not have known what road to take because it didnt say the direction to go in. Simply not enough information.Another gripe, re-route is not an automated feature. I wish Microsoft would have put an option on the program to AUTO RE-ROUTE if you are off of the designated route when using your laptop and the locator. Instead it says OFF ROUTE and you either have to drive back on route or press the F3 button or click the RE-ROUTE button. Seems silly it cant do this automatically.And one last gripe, there is an offramp here in knoxville where you can not make a right turn, it is posted and illegal. This software when I am on my way to work constantly tells me to make that right turn. That is one big issue.Overall, the product works as expected for a $90 GPS solution. It would have received 5 stars if the Pocket PC piece actually was useful and if a few of the roads around me that had been around were in the database. It works decent, but not good enough. This is a good test program to use to see if GPS is for you. I have since stopped using the GPS locator part and simply use streets and trips at home to plan my trips, figure out mileage, etc. I now use a Magellan Roadmate 760 which I purchased here at Amazon as my in car navigation system.I would have expected Microsoft, the large company they are to have a more up to date, hi-tech program. This thing doesnt speak street names, doesnt tell which dirction to go when approaching freeways and interstates. It will get you where you are going, but the lack of updated roads make take you well out of your way to get there.", "unixReviewTime": "1156464000"}

Well, Toast 7 does everything you wish your Mac could.First, DVD burning.  Toast allows you to import all sorts of video files, and burn them onto a video DVD, for viewing in your set-top DVD player.  This is a great feature, if you have some Divx video files, on your hard drive.  Drag them into the video folder in toast, and burn a video DVD.Furthermore, do you have some un-encrypted DVDs, perhaps ones made in your set-top DVD recorder with video camera footage of your family?  With toast, you can import titles from those unencrypted DVDs, and put them onto a DVD, with fun and easy to navigate menus.New to Toast 7 is a great new feature that allows you to compress an unencrypted video DVD image into a size that will fit onto a single-layer disk.  This basically gives you the functionality of popcorn built right into Toast 7.Data Backup - Toast works fantastic as a backup utility.  There is even an application included to schedule backups on a regular basis.  Toast 7 allows for disk-spanning backups, which allows you to backup many gigabytes of data over multiple DVDs or CDs.Audio - Toast 7 will obviously allow you to burn music CDs, but you can also burn a DVD.  The DVD will load on a set-top DVD player, with menus, to select music, and a shuffle feature.  You can get gigabytes of music onto these disks, and then play them in your DVD player.Pictures - Toast 7 includes an application called Motion Pictures HD, which allows the importing of photos to make great slideshows.  They can be in beautiful widescreen, or even high-definition, if you make a Divx DVD (note that Divx DVDs can only be played in special DVD players).Import Analog Audio - CD Spin Doctor is included with Toast 7, so you can easily import analog audio via your computers audio input.  You might input audio, from a VHS tape, cassette tape, or record.Discus RE - Discus RE is a simple, but convenient way to create labels, for your DVDs.  It includes the templates, for dozens of the most popular DVD labels, so then all you have to do is design your label and print it.  Easy.[...]Overall, I have only had Toast 7, for a few days now.  However, it might be the most useful application I have ever purchased, for my Macintosh.  Toast 7 allows you to do just about anything you would want to do, when it comes to burning DVDs and CDs.  Furthermore, it is easy to use.  I was taking advantage of Toast 7s many features within just minutes of installing the software.  Give Toast 7 a try, for it will quickly become one of the most used applications on your Mac.", "unixReviewTime": "1126828800"}

Big mistake.Although Ive been using computers for 20 years now (mostly Macs), Ive had nothing but problems with this new version of Toast. I havent had a single successful burn yet, on any kind of media, recording any kind of format.  I thought updating to the latest version might be helpful, but Roxio wont let you download it unless youre a registered user on their website.Understandable - but I AM a registered user, and their system wouldnt recognize me. So I tried to open a new account, and it wouldnt let me. Okay, I clicked their forgot my password button, and they say theyll send me a link via email. Ive played that little game for about 3 days now, and never a message/link from Roxio.Trying to solve my tech problems online hasnt helped; Toast keeps giving me error codes which arent defined anywhere on Roxios help pages.Maybe, some bright and glorious day, Ill actually get the program to work and it will merit more than 1 star. But my old version (5.2.3) worked fine, and I dropped a lot of money for a few glittery features...and instead lost all the previous functionality and raised my blood pressure in the bargain. Shame on you, Roxio!UPDATE:  Okay, three hair-pulling days later I STILL havent had a successful burn. Its amazing what new features Roxio has added this time around. For instance, Toast will tell you that you have more than enough room on your disk for the burn, then grind away for an hour or so, then pop up a message saying Ooh, sorry, theres not enough space after all.  Or its fun to ask it to burn a VCD - at which point it suddenly cant find my disc burner anymore (funny, it was there a moment ago).  Want to compress a long movie the way you can in Popcorn? Well, theres probably a way - but [CENSORED] if I can find it by steering through Toasts incredibly unintuitive interface.And, oh yes, Roxios website still wont admit that Im a customer. If you log on with a new email address and password (as a new user), youll be able to download the latest update. And youd better do it during that session, because next time you try to log on, Roxio will have no recollection of your sign-in information (well nearly none - they recognize your email address, but deny your password so you CANT log in. Ask them to send you a password reminder, and nothing ever ever ever comes.)Ive used Toast for years, and thought it was a great program. Im NOT an idiot - honest. But Toast Titanium 7 has so far been a complete and frustrating waste of my money. ZERO STARS!!!!!!!!!!!  (Roxio - I loathe you!)UPDATE #2 - After a month of trying, Ive finally been able to burn a single disk! Wow! Of course, I could have done this with iDVD, any earlier version of Toast, or simply the Macs OS...but where would the challenge (or expense) be in that? Currently Im trying to make one of the much-touted Music DVD disks - but for some reason, even though all of my music files are ALREADY compressed to the MP3 specs that Roxio wants, its re-encoding every freakin song. On a G4 Mac with dual processors, it seems like it will take about 8 hours to create a single disk. And really, all Toast is doing is adding a menu structure to an MP3 disk that should have taken about 10 minutes to burn. To quote Monty Python: RUN AWAY!! RUN AWAY!!", "unixReviewTime": "1155513600"}
{"overall": 5.0, "reviewerID": "A1VLVWTLV3LVHR", "asin": "B000AP2X1E", "reviewText": "Roxio Toast 7Company: RoxioPrice: $99[...]We here at MyMac.com have been reviewing Roxio Toast for years. The problem, then, is how do you review a new version that, for all intents and purposes, does not add many new real features to the software, looks the same as it did a full version ago, and is just as easy to use as it ever was? Well, perhaps its a bit easier for me, as I did not write either of the reviews for version 5 or 6. (That would be Owen Rubin and David Weeks.) Nonetheless, lets give a look a Toast 7 for the uninitiated among you.For Mac users wondering why they would need to purchase a $99 program to burn CDs and DVDs when they get those functions with a free program (iTunes for CDs, as well as data burning within the finder) or as part of a larger software package (iLife, more specifically iDVD for DVD creation) the answer is simple: where iTunes and iDVD falls short in their simplicity, Toast gives users much more control and options. This is not always a good thing; most Mac users enjoy the simplicity in the OS and iLife. But more serious or hardcore users will find, many times, that they need more options.Toast can be used to create data back-ups, create and burn audio CDs and video DVDs, create other media discs (DivX, Super Video CDs, Video CDs, DVDs from Video-TS files) and much more. Toast plays nicely with the Mac OS, including giving the user access to iTunes libraries and playlists, the user movie library, and iPhoto, including all the photo albums therein. We will get more into the media features of Toast later in the review.The newest feature I was most looking forward to is Data Spanning. This alone, in my opinion, is the sole reason to purchase Roxio Toast 7. Archiving large files, such as the video projects I work on, is now very simple with Data Spanning. For instance, I recently worked on remastering an old wedding video for a client, converting a VHS tape to DVD, as well as creating a highlight DVD in the process. The finished iMovie file was 25.98GB in size. While I could simply create a copy of the finished DVDs, I also wanted to keep on hand the iMovie archive of the project, in case the client came back later wanting to do something different with the footage. But how to archive almost 26GB of data? Sure, external FireWire drives would work, but I dont want to take up valuable hard disk space for a file I may never need again. Much more convenient to simply archive it to data CDs or DVDs. But the file is too large to fit onto either of those media.Data Spanning solves this easily. I simply drag the file in question to the open Toast window, and the program will tell me how many discs I need, depending upon what media I will be using. In this instance, Toast informs me that I will need 6 blank DVDs, or 38 blank CDs, to archive the project. A ten pack of blank DVDs will only set me back five bucks, which is much cheaper than taking up storage space on an external hard drive. Data Spanning, however, only works with Mac discs, not Mac and PC, so keep that in mind.Toast has the ability to copy home brewed DVDs with ease. While the program will not allow you to copy copy-protected discs, such as movies you rent, you can copy those you made in iDVD. This came in handy for me a short time ago, as I had lost all my iAtariMac MacMOD files. Just gone. My only option was to grab the low quality files from the Internet. But thanks to Chad Perry, who had MacMOD on DVD, I simply copied his DVD.As I said, Toast is unable to make copies of any DVD with Macrovision encryption, meaning commercial movie DVDs. So whats a person to do if they want to copy their own DVDs? For me, I used MacTheRipper, a free program, to copy an entire DVD to my hard drive, stripping out the encryption at the same time. Then I used Toast to burn a regular DVD from that file, and viola! - an instant copy of my movie. While you could also do the same thing with rented DVDs, that would be stealing, and we dont condone that here at MyMac.com, of course.The interface of Toast 7 is the same as the previous version, which is a good thing. If something is not broken, theres no need to fix it. Toast uses a tabbed interface, which includes Data (data backups, copying data, etc.), Audio (to create music CDs, with many more options than you get from iTunes), Video (see above), and Copy (self explanatory). Each tab will bring up different options with a slide-out left preference pane, so that you can adjust or tweak different options as needed. For instance, the Data pane will show different types of disc you can burn, such as a Mac-only disc or a Mac and PC disc. The preference pane also links to the iLife media on your Mac, giving you quick and easy drag and drop access to your files.You can author your own DVD menus using Toast 7, although I havent spent much time doing so. It seems fairly straightforward, but after a cursory playing with this feature, I simply found iDVD much easier and intuitive to use.With Toast 7, you can download DivX video files, drag them into Toast, and create DVDs playable on your home entertainments DVD player. As Roxio touts on their website, this lets you watch videos where you really want to; on your coach, watching the television, not on your computer monitor.All in all, I am very impressed with this new version of Roxio Toast. It has become my disc burning solution of choice. Well worth the money for those needing to create easy backups, archiving, and much more.MyMac.com Rating: 5 out of 5", "unixReviewTime": "1146700800"}

Ill try to be as much non-techie as possible.I have evaluated numerous products, available today in market. From Norton to Norman. After due considerations, which essentially depends on cost + features I bought this product.I was pleasantly surprised. Lets review in more detail --1. Anti-virus : The product has a very, very good anti-virus protection. For those who know, nowadays the original virus infection has died down considerably. This is because, viruses need a way to propagate, which earlier was floppies, then emails. Nowadays all email providers have good enterprise-level scanners preventing the spread of viruses and with broadband a detected virus is neutralized quickly since info. bout the virus is quickly dissapated and scanners upgrade themselves realtime.2. Firewall : The best in the market, I mean it! With the network protection + OS firewall protection available - it means that if this is installed from day-1; all available ports (TCP/UDP) are by default blocked. The good part: The pop-up encourages 2 options - Temp/Perm. of either opening / blocking the port. Thus, user doesnt get repeated msgs. I used a particular component called SNOOP; which basically tries to find open ports across the network. Tried to Snoop into the ZA protected machine - not sucessfuly. Used SNOOP to GO OUT from ZA protected machine, ZA provided pop-ups for each such attempt.3. Anti-spyware and privacy protection -> very, very solid.Heres the BAD POINTS -> There should be a background scanner, which scans the CONFIGURED options in program control, component control, etc. to determine those that are (a) No more valid as (maybe) s/w has been un-installed/changed (b) not used for a very long time. Those should be cleaned automatically. Why ? As time passes by, due to large and large amount of data residing in these 2 sections, more and more time is required to load ZA.-> Bad backup options available. God forbid, if you have some issues requiring re-installation of ZA. Then youll need to re-configure everything from scratch! The backup and restore option do not restore everything.-> Game mode : Not very clear in its use; for upon using it; found spywares entering the systems.-> Poor support for Firefox - Although firefox is more stable, however there should be more in-built protection from ZA towards Firefox.-> Cache cleaner : Not very complete, leaves a large number of MRU lists un-cleaned.Terrific points : Absolutely the best firewall protection and identity protection suite available. Its the customer exp. that matters. When (for ex.) an user wants to protect his name; all other products I have evaluated have their pop-up popping up each time. ZA pops up; you select Allow always; bingo its done.Next - the expert rule features; helped me to configure advanced settings so much so that when I am in Extranet (VPN) I can access my office network comfortably without sacrificing on security.FEATURE REQUEST - A gateway service as part of the firewall, whereby ZA can act as a software gateway for all browsers, thus effectively protecting the real IP address.", "unixReviewTime": "1156464000"}

I chose ZoneAlarm due to the high ratings of the firewall by PC Magazine and due to rebates.I do believe that ZoneAlarm is a very good firewall, but there are issues that I have been having with the software that would cause me to hesitate to purchase it again.  Both ZoneAlarm and Norton have the option to teach the firewall which programs should be allowed to access the internet or to make changes to the registry and which program should be prevented from doing so.  Both programs popup alerts to ask the user for input.  However, Norton has a much more complete list of programs which are threats and which are safe.  For example, ZoneAlarm gave warning for programs such as Internet Explorer, Windows Updater, Adobe PDF and the Restore Wizard.  All of these are programs that are probably on at least 90% of the PCs out there.  Why didnt ZoneAlarm add them to the safe list so that the user would not be bothered?  It seems a simple thing to do to reduce the aggravation of the alerts.On my PC I have an advertisement blocking software that I have been using for years.  Norton noticed it but once I told Norton that the program was safe, Norton left it alone.  ZoneAlarm gives me alerts about this program each time I startup and shut down windows.  I have told ZoneAlarm that the program is trusted, but I have not been successful in stopping the annoying alerts which require me to click in a window before the computer will finish booting or shutting down.During the installation, ZoneAlarm did not successfully install my license key and gave me warnings that my updates would expire in 21 days.  I contacted customer support via email (calling them costs a few dollars per minute) and was pleasantly surprised that I received a response within hours, even on the weekend.  I never got such a response from Norton or McAffe.  Kudos to ZoneAlarm for have a very responsive customer support team.In summary, a very good firewall and good antivirus and antispam product.

Theres a brief 3 minute tutorial that lets ZA know your level of computer experteise.  If youre a novice, ZA will self-configure the firewall.

Sometimes it doesnt have a suggestion, so heres where some common sense comes in, as well as some PC experteise.If youre installing a program, or uninstalling, or running a program, and ZA pops up, then it probably is something you want to allow, or it will block what youre trying to do.McAfee is effective but slow, Norton doesnt pick up everything and sometimes cant delete things and you have to do it manually, Trend Micro also has failed in automatic deletion and has many manual removal messages for various viruses and trojans (and were paying for what?).Zone Labs is one of the few that have caught, and automatically deleted most test viruses and trojans (and real) that Ive run on my PC.It wins out over the other 3 in that it gives the user super control over the PC.

If you dont know, then get a different program.  McAfee and Norton are effective but you dont get the control and ease of use.  Trend Micro is the easiest of all, but you dont get firewall controll over outbound connections.So, this is not a novice program, and should be used by the more experienced.Overall, the speed and firewall coupled with an antivirus program that actually works led me to keep ZoneLabs my internet security suite for over 2 years now.  (though I do run McAfee, AVG, Norton, and trend on other pcs), on my personal PC that I use the most, I trust ZA for the best security.PC Geek tested and approved!  A.They only get 4 stars because they charge you for customer support (BOO 70 dollars isnt enough for the program AND support?).  Otherwise, this is a must have for anyone truly concerned about PC and internet security.", "unixReviewTime": "1134777600"}

Why?1) If you have automatic updates ON, it eats up your bandwidth so you can do NOTHING on the Internet until the update completes. Neat. I thought I purchased my computers to use, not to maintain and I purchased this absolutely worthless product to protect me while I was on the Internet2) If you have automatic updates OFF (which is the only way you can use it given (1, then you basically have to do the updates manually when you know that you will not be using your computer. Great.3) I have a half dozen licenses for this product. However, because Windows XP is little more than a continuing security exposure, I only use one computer on this Internet, this one. The ONLY time the other computers are on the Internet is for software updates. Normally, therefore, I only update NIS 2006 on a monthly basis or so (Since it is not needed. If you read 4) & 5) you can see why there is absolutely no incentive to update this product at all since it is just a problem). The problem is that essentially 100% of the time, when I attempt to update NIS 2006, it crashes (Internal error, etc).4) I live in the sticks so that DSL is not available, therefore I am stuck with dialup. (Satellite is not acceptable for many, many reasons, btw). The consequences of 3), that NIS 2006 always ALWAYS crashes during the update process, is that all updates have to be done piecemeal, one at a time as I try to find some workaround to get it to update. The problem with this, is that even the individual updates fail (Internal error) Therefore I have to spend hours updating each computer: Updates | Select individual update from list | LONG download | Internal error. Repeat || Try another individual update from list | LONG download | Internal error. So, as I said, I have to spend hours trying to find some workaround for EACH computer trying to get NIS 2006 to ever update.5) The consequences of 1) and 3), is there is an extremely strong disincentive to update NIS 2006 at all (Besides the fact that every once in awhile your license spontaneously EXPIRES and you have to solve that problem in addition). The end result of this is that I spend far more time trying to update NIS 2006 than I actually spend doing anything productive. (Then there is that wonderful Windows Genuine Advantage, that makes the Windows update process miserable)6) I would estimate that I end up doing several failed UPDATES, before this piece of junk finally updates, properly. That is a lot of time at 28.8K to 38.6KSymantec has BILLIONS of dollars for acquisitions yet they dont give a damn about providing a product than even works (and they never will give a damn or provide a product that works) (BTW, I notice that as the years progress, almost all software is getting even more unreliable)Hopefully, I have made my point (The real shame is that the other products have their own problems, as well, so you are pretty well damned if you do and damned if you dont)Roy", "unixReviewTime": "1157328000"}
